The management came with the idea of creating a 2+2 coupe based on the same stainless-steel chassis and same underpinnings provided by Ford.</p><p>Unlike its roadster sibling, the Aceca featured two slim, horizontal headlights in 1998. In late 1999 though, the carmaker made an updated version with glass-covered, flush to bodywork headlights. While the main proportions remained similar to the roadster, most body panels changed from the A-pillar rearwards. Its closed cockpit featured a rounded greenhouse with a sloped window area above the trunk. A duck-tail ended the cabin above the rounded taillights from behind.</p><p>Inside, the carmaker managed to squeeze a bench for two at the back, while the front occupants were pampered with the same room as on the roadster. The British manufacturer chose not to lower the car\'s price and fitted it with a leather-clad interior. On the center stack, it placed the AC-control unit and a CD player. Since it was considered a GT vehicle, it sported luxurious items such as standard power windows, heated windshield and mirrors, plus wood trims on the dash and the center console.</p><p>Under the hood, depending on the customers\' options, the Aceca was offered a choice of three engines ranging between 3.5- and 5.0-liter. A five-speed manual was featured as standard, while a four-speed automatic was available as an option.</p>',NULL,'[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ac-aceca-1998-7214_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ac-aceca-1998-7214_2.jpg\"]','2024-10-23 05:32:21','2024-10-23 05:32:21'),(2,'d2040710','https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/ac-ace-1993.html',1,'AC  Ace 1993-1996 Photos, engines &amp; full specs ','<p><strong>After gaining full control over the AC brand, Ford and Brian Angliss tried to revive the British brand with innovative products to lead the small carmaker into new territories.</strong></p><p></p><p>While the original Ace was worldwide famous, the 1993 model started on the wrong foot since everyone expected the same results as its \'50s and \'60s predecessors. Later on, the car was mostly known as the Brooklands Ace to cut the confusion.</p><p>This time, the car was designed by Len Bailey as a 2+2 open-top vehicle. The first prototype, known as \"Ace of Spades,\" featured a targa-top, but the final model, which arrived in 1993, featured a classic roadster shape. Again, to cut costs, Ford provided most of the car\'s underpinnings, including the round headlights and turn signals.</p><p>At the front, the car\'s narrow end with a small radiator grille looked spot-on for a modern roadster. After installing a V8 under the hood, the carmaker had to create a bulge to make room for the air filter, which it did. Unlike the concept car, this was a genuine, two-seat roadster. Its thick A-pillars and steep windshield protected them while driving, while an electric retractable canvas-top kept them dry from the rain. At the back, the carmaker installed a short trunk and a four-round taillights setup, and a dual exhaust system.</p><p>Inside, Ace offered a leather-clad interior and plenty of standard features such as a stereo tape CD player, air-conditioning, power windows and mirrors, and an electrically heated windshield.</p><p>Under the aluminum bodywork, the carmaker installed the first-ever stainless-steel chassis in the industry. Its nearly 50:50 weight distribution made it a nimble car, and the limited-slip differential helped in many ways. A standard ABS and a powerful V8 engine completed the package.</p>',NULL,'[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ac-ace-1993-7215_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ac-ace-1993-7215_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ac-ace-1993-7215_3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ac-ace-1993-7215_4.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ac-ace-1993-7215_5.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ac-ace-1993-7215_6.jpg\"]','2024-10-23 05:32:22','2024-10-23 05:32:22'),(3,'30f0b4c3','https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/ac-428-convertible-1966.html',1,'AC  428 Convertible 1966-1971 Photos, engines &amp; full specs ','<p><strong>In 1966, AC cut a deal with the Italian coachbuilder Frua to create a luxurious Grand Touring convertible for the British carmaker, and the result was unique.</strong></p><p></p><p>The AC Frua was not the best of two worlds.

2023 when it introduced the ZDX as its first full-electric SUV. Usually, automakers started with sedans and evolved later with SUVs. But the Japanese premium brand took a different approach and made the ZDX its forerunner in the electric car revolution.</strong></p><p></p><p>Honda made its first full-electric vehicle, the E, in 2020. It was not a huge success, but the automaker learned what customers want from an electron-powered vehicle. So, three years later, it brought another EV. Only this time, it was not sold under Honda\'s badge but on Acura\'s logo. Moreover, creating an entirely new platform specifically designed for EVs paved the way for other such vehicles built and sold by both brands.</p><p>Acura introduced the Precision EV Concept at the 2022 Monterey Car Week, and many people thought that it was just another show car with no real future. Yet, Acura proved them wrong, and one year later, it unveiled the production version of that SUV under the ZDX nameplate. Acura\'s design studio from California designed the vehicle and carefully incorporated the brand\'s specific details onto the car. As a result, the front fascia featured the same pentagonal-shaped grille, although it was mostly blocked since electric vehicles didn\'t need wide cooling areas. That was flanked by LED headlights with a shape that resembled the ones from other Acura products, such as the Integra Type S. On the outer sides of the lower front bumper, the design team created scoops that created a sporty image for the SUV. Several silver trims adorned the front fascia and continued on the sides, on the vehicle\'s skirts. The greenhouse looked different than other Acura products since it featured a free-floating design emphasized by the chromed trim that surrounded the upper side of the windows\' area and was sloped down on the C-pillars. Since Acura was mostly a premium yet sporty brand, the designers penned a raked-forward tailgate adorned by a roof spoiler at the back.</p><p>The car\'s interior was up to Acura\'s standards, boasting a high level of technology, refinement, and comfort. In front of the driver, the automaker installed an 11\" digital instrument cluster, while atop the center stack mounted an additional 11.3\" touchscreen for the infotainment system. The car had integrated Google Maps, and it could display it on either screen. Moreover, it could suggest routes based on the charging stations available on the routes and even precondition the battery pack to speed up charging sessions. Since the vehicle was so silent, the automaker considered installing an 18-speaker Bang&amp;Olufsen audio system that provided a surround sound experience. The front bucket seats offered enough side bolstering and were separated by a tall center console, which hosted two storage areas and a pair of cup holders.</p><p>Acura offered the ZDX with two available powertrains: a two-wheel-drive version with one motor for the rear axle and an all-wheel-drive one with motors on both ends of the SUV. The former was estimated to cover 325 miles (523 km) on a single charge.</p>','<strong>The new 2024 Acura ZDX is Acura\'s first all-electric model. With an estimated 500 hp in the Type S model, ZDX delivers on Acura\'s commitment to Precision Crafted Performance with dynamic styling, class-leading premium technology and an engaging driving experience. The ZDX A-Spec single-motor is anticipated to receive an EPA range rating of 325 zero-emission miles.<br> </strong><br> Making its global debut at several premier events during 2023 Monterey Car Week, one of the world\'s top gatherings of automotive and motorsports enthusiasts, the all-electric ZDX marks a critical step on Acura\'s accelerated path to a 100% electrified lineup.<br> <br> \"The arrival of the new ZDX is an exciting moment for the Acura brand,\" said Emile Korkor, Assistant Vice President of Acura National Sales. \"It signals our transition to a zero-emissions future and demonstrates our commitment to Precision Crafted Performance in the electrified era.\"<br> <br> Acura will offer the ZDX A-Spec in both single-motor (rear-wheel-drive) and dual-motor (all-wheel-drive) configurations. The 2024 ZDX A-Spec is expected to start in the $60,000 range. The ZDX Type S, the most powerful and best performing Acura SUV ever, will feature a performance tuned dual-motor AWD powertrain and is expected to start in the $70,000 range. All Acura ZDX sales will take place through a new, omni-channel digital sales process, ensuring a simple and intuitive shopping experience from home or at an Acura dealership. Pre-sale activities for ZDX will start in late 2023, with first client deliveries slated for early 2024.<br> <br> Design and Technology<br> <br> Exterior and interior styling was led by a team at the Acura Design Studio in Los Angeles, marking the production debut of the Acura exterior design direction introduced on the Acura Precision EV Concept at 2022 Monterey Car Week. Low and wide with a sleek silhouette, long wheelbase and high contrast surfacing, ZDX expresses Acura\'s intense focus on performance from every angle. Distinct design details include the evolution of Acura\'s signature front fascia, with the brand\'s iconic Chicane DRLs, Jewel Eye™ LED headlights, and seamless Diamond Pentagon with 3-D embossed diamond pattern and illuminated surround.<br> <br> \"As Acura moves into an exhilarating, electrified future, we will continue to push the forward-thinking design and proportions of our products as we take full advantage of the increased styling and packaging freedom EVs offer,\" said Dave Marek, Acura Executive Creative Director. \"Embracing that creative liberation, our team was energized designing ZDX, Acura\'s new modern expression of performance.\"<br> <br> Further bridging concept and production, the ZDX Type S debuts an all-new Acura color - Double Apex Blue Pearl, which also was previewed on the Acura Precision EV Concept. Additionally, the ZDX will be available in the Type S signature Tiger Eye Pearl, also offered on Acura TLX Type S, MDX Type S and Integra Type S.<br> <br> Inside ZDX, the driver-oriented cockpit features high-end materials, premium features and expansive intuitive technologies, including Acura\'s first integration of Google built-in for seamless on-the-go connectivity. Standard across the ZDX lineup, apps like Google Assistant and Google Maps and more on Google Play help deliver a connected, personalized and more streamlined driving experience.<br> <br> Acura ZDX features a combined 22-inches of high-definition digital screen real estate with a standard Precision Cockpit Driver Information Cluster (11-inches) and Center Information Screen (11.3 inches) with an intuitive touchscreen interface and wireless Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™ compatibility. Through ZDX\'s Google built-in system, Google Maps can be displayed on either screen providing sophisticated route planning with recommended charging stations to optimize travel time. Google Maps also can estimate the charging time4 required to reach the destination and can initiate preconditioning of the EV battery when the destination is a DC Fast charging station. Battery preconditioning can reduce charge times, getting clients back on the road quickly.<br> <br> ZDX is the first Acura model to feature the immersive, luxury audio experience of Bang &amp; Olufsen, an iconic brand for audiophiles recognized for the creation of innovative audio systems for home and automotive applications alike. Standard on all ZDX models, the bespoke system has been engineered exclusively for the tech-rich cabin of the all-electric SUV with 18 speakers, including four in the headliner, 14-channels of amplification and a subwoofer to deliver powerful and sophisticated sound. (See Bang &amp; Olufsen section below for more information.)<br> <br> ZDX comes standard with AcuraWatch™, a suite of safety and driver assistive technologies, including Acura\'s first applications of Rear Cross Traffic Braking and Blind Zone Steering Assist.<br> <br> With the new AcuraWatch™ 360+ system, ZDX Type S introduces Hands Free Cruise driver assistance technology to the Acura lineup, enabling true hands-free driving on up to 400,000 miles of compatible roads, helping to make long drives and commutes more comfortable. ZDX Type S\' AcuraWatch™ 360+ also features the first Automatic Parking Assist system in an Acura, which helps take the stress out of parallel parking.<br> <br> All-Electric Acura Performance<br> <br> Built upon a state-of-the-art electric vehicle platform with a flexible battery architecture, a low center of gravity and near 50/50 weight distribution, the all-electric ZDX expands Acura\'s lineup of premium, performance SUVs. ZDX A-Spec is powered by a rear-mounted single-motor producing an estimated 340 horsepower; ZDX A-Spec is also available dual-motor, all-wheel drive configuration. Acura engineers have tuned ZDX\'s multi-link front and rear suspension to deliver a premium driving experience with exhilarating performance and class-leading refinement.<br> <br> As with all high-performance Acura Type S models, ZDX Type S significantly enhances every element of the performance driving experience, including acceleration, braking and turning, all without compromising comfort, refinement or daily drivability. ZDX Type S will define Acura performance for the electrified era with an estimated 500 horsepower, a height adjustable air suspension, performance-tuned adaptive dampers and massive 15.6-inch Brembo™ front brakes with eye-catching 6-piston yellow calipers. Drivers can customize the driving experience with multiple drive modes, including a Sport mode for maximum acceleration and response.<br> <br> The athletic stance and proportions of Acura ZDX are complemented in the Type S model by 22-inch machine-finished wheels, the largest ever for an Acura model, and wider 275/40ZR22 self-sealing tires. Available high-performance summer tires, packaged with a gloss-black wheel, further increase Type S\' performance capabilities.<br> <br> Recharging on the go is quick and convenient with DC Fast Charging at rates up to 190 kW. With DC Fast Charging in approximately 10 minutes, the 102-kWh lithium-ion battery pack in ZDX A-Spec rear-wheel drive can gain an estimated 81 miles of range.<br> <br> Bang &amp; Olufsen Luxury Audio Experience<br> <br> Long recognized for its advanced audio performance, Acura\'s new collaboration with Bang &amp; Olufsen, the Danish luxury audio brand, will elevate the in-vehicle audio experience of the new 2024 Acura ZDX and the entire Acura lineup in the coming years.<br> <br> Acura ZDX and ZDX Type S will feature Bang &amp; Olufsen\'s latest 3D Sound Control and exclusive Beosonic feature and Acoustic Lens Technology.

Occupying its new position as the brand flagship, the next-generation Acura MDX marks a quantum leap forward with a bold exterior design coupled with a sophisticated and elegant new interior featuring the most high-tech and advanced cockpit in the brand\'s 35-year history. Fully developed around Acura\'s Precision Crafted Performance brand DNA, and built on an all-new platform designed for new levels of performance, the 2022 MDX will arrive at dealers in the US on Feb. 2, 2021 with a Manufacturer\'s Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) starting at $46,900.<br> </strong><br> Elevated Exterior Design<br> <br> As the most emotionally styled Acura MDX ever, the fourth-generation model features a bold and upright face, intricately sculpted grille and hood, and a wide, aggressive stance. These cues are shared with the Acura Precision Concept that redefined Acura design when it was first unveiled in 2016. Dimensionally, the new MDX sits on a 2.8-inch longer wheelbase, with a stance that\'s 1.4 inches wider in the front and rear.<br> <br> Perhaps the most significant dimensional change is the dash-to-axle ratio, which has been extended by nearly 6 inches. This lengthens the hood line significantly, giving MDX a premium \"cab rearward\" proportion, and emphasizing the power under its long and sharply creased hood. The bold and sporting new look is accentuated by a multi-faceted Diamond Pentagon grille and new four-element JewelEye® LED headlights with an embedded Chicane™ daytime running light. Three-dimensional sculpting under the headlights serve to visually widen the front, blending to the fog light housing at the bottom.<br> <br> The wide stance and larger-diameter wheels are pushed to the edge of the bodywork, providing visual cues of the dynamic handling potential of MDX\'s new body and chassis architecture with front double-wishbone suspension and high-capacity, variable-ratio steering. The three-dimensional surface details were inspired by the wind-shaped rocks in Arizona\'s Antelope Canyon, and can be seen in the pronounced shoulder line that defines the upper portion of the vehicle, and the sculpting along the lower portion of the doors.<br> <br> The Acura MDX\'s windows are framed by a chrome strip (gloss black on A-Spec models) that begins in front of the mirrors on the front fender, running under the outside mirrors and ultimately circling the side windows. In the rear, the wide-set taillights have their Chicane™ design set in an eye-catching light-blade, and serve to define and enhance the width and stability of the pronounced rear fenders.<br> <br> All-New Body and Chassis<br> <br> The all-new light truck platform underpinning the 2022 MDX targets the driving dynamics of a sport sedan. Designed from the outset in pursuit of Type S levels of performance, MDX sports its first-ever double-wishbone front suspension, combined with an all-new multilink rear suspension for incredibly precise road holding while maintaining the smooth ride that is a key MDX highlight. The new platform also features improved body rigidity, paying dividends in ride comfort and handling in combination with improved collision safety performance. Quick, precise steering and more powerful brakes give the driver the ability to take full advantage of the new platform, in driving scenarios ranging from daily commutes to twisting canyon roads.<br> <br> Acura MDX\'s double wishbone front suspension is a core feature of Acura\'s performance DNA. The suspension delivers a larger tire contact patch through corners, helping to increase grip, while improving ride quality with greater vertical freedom of movement. The new rear suspension also improves stability and response, and together they give MDX a world-class combination of ride comfort and agility.<br> <br> The new platform includes multiple enhancements in rigidity. In front, the damper connects to a new cast aluminum housing that is 45-percent stiffer overall for better noise isolation, with a new rigid-mounted subframe contributing to a 7-percent increase in lateral torsion for better handling. Replacing the previous floating-type subframe, the new front subframe translates steering inputs to the tires with greater speed and fidelity. The rear body uses a new dual-balanced load path for the rear damper mounting points, contributing to a 41-percent improvement in stiffness for better noise isolation, and 80-percent torsion improvement that benefits handling.<br> <br> Steering<br> <br> The 2022 MDX uses new belt-driven Electric Power Steering (EPS) with a high-output electric motor for increased steering assist, essential for the quicker steering ratio afforded by the new variable gear ratio steering system. The new EPS system\'s variable gear ratio system is designed and tuned to provide the most essential characteristics, such as instantaneous response with a smooth, natural and precise steering feel. The variable ratio gives the new MDX increased agility in a variety of driving scenarios.<br> <br> Improved Braking Performance<br> <br> For 2022, Acura MDX features enhanced braking capability, with larger and thicker front brake rotors, and a new electric brake booster. With front rotors that are 2mm thicker and 30mm larger in diameter, the new brakes can better withstand repeated hard stops without reduced performance (fade) thanks to a nearly 18-percent increase in heat capacity. The new electric brake booster allows the Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS™) to react 230 milliseconds faster, reducing stopping distance from 30 mph by 12 feet.<br> <br> Wheels and Tires<br> <br> New wheel and tire packages give the 2022 MDX a stronger stance for a powerful presence, while increasing contact patch stiffness by 15-percent in lateral loads for improved handling performance. Standard 19x8.5 (+1 in. diameter, +0.5 in. width) wheels are wrapped in wider 255 (+10mm) series tires take full advantage of the steering and suspension updates to the new platform. Available 20x9.0 wheels (+0.5 in. width) use special in-wheel resonators to reduce road noise when driving over uneven surfaces at highway speeds. A new tire developed exclusively for MDX features a revised rubber compound, construction and tread pattern to reduce rolling resistance by 17-percent.<br> <br> Exterior Colors and Trim<br> <br> The 2022 Acura MDX will be available in two standard (non-metallic) color finishes and six premium colors including two new offerings; Phantom Violet Pearl first offered on the 2021 TLX and an all-new Liquid Carbon Metallic. Apex Blue Pearl returns as an exclusive color offered on the MDX A-Spec. Gloss black accents front to rear, darkened headlight and taillight treatment and Shark-Gray wheels add a distinct sport appearance to the MDX A-Spec.<br> <br> Driver-Focused Cabin with Room for 6 Passengers<br> <br> Befitting its flagship status, the 2022 Acura MDX delivers the most premium and sophisticated cabin Acura has ever designed. The clean, horizontal design theme imparts a strong structural feel, softened with the use of high-grade authentic materials such as open-pore wood, brushed aluminum and soft-touch Milano leather. A hand-wrapped instrument panel with available top-stitching provides a premium touch beyond anything offered in MDX to date.<br> <br> First-class front seat comfort is enabled via next-generation Acura sport seats featuring 12-way adjustment, three-way seat heating and three-position memory - all standard. MDX A-Spec adds ventilated front seats while the Advance Package gains additional power-adjusting side bolsters and thigh extensions for 16-way adjustment.<br> <br> In the second-row, 2022 MDX features a first-in-class multi-function removable middle seat providing owners three discrete seating options; a traditional bench for 3-across seating and 7-passenger total capacity (middle seat up), a captain\'s chair style wide center armrest with additional drink holders (middle seat down), or wide pass-through for access to the third row (middle seat removed), particularly useful when child seats are installed in the outboard second-row seats.<br> <br> A hallmark of the Acura MDX since its introduction in 2001, the third row is further improved on the 2022 MDX with an additional 0.4-inches of headroom, 2.4-inches of legroom and a seating position that\'s 2-inches higher from the floor compared to the outgoing model. With the new standard panoramic moonroof on all MDX trims, the third row has a light and spacious feeling. In MDX Advance trim, third-row occupants have their own USB charging ports on the left and right side of the cabin.<br> <br> Behind the third row, cargo space has been increased to 16.3 cu.-ft. (+1.5) and can expand up to 71.4 cu.-ft. (+3.0) with both second and third rows folded. The new MDX also features expanded under-floor storage behind the third row, with 80-percent more space available under the cargo floor. The floor panel drops into the cargo well to expand the MDX\'s rear cargo area behind the third row to 18.1 cubic feet, and is reversible, with a carpeted side and an easy-to-clean hard side for dirty or wet items.<br> <br> Interior Colors &amp; Trim<br> <br> Acura MDX also will be available in six different interior color schemes, depending on package, including Ebony, Parchment, Graystone and Espresso. A-Spec models will be available exclusively in either Ebony or Red leather with black Ultrasuede® inserts. MDX with Technology Package and above feature seats wrapped in a rich, soft-touch Milano leather seating surfaces with contrast stitching while Advance Package models add contrast piping for all three rows.<br> <br> All New: Precision Cockpit™ Digital Instrumentation<br> <br> The 2022 Acura MDX features the new, all-digital Acura Precision Cockpit™, which replaces physical gauges with a customizable 12.3-inch driver\'s meter. The new Precision Cockpit conveys information to the driver in personalized fashion, with drivers able to choose between two distinct appearances - Advanced and Crafted. In addition to different displays for the main gauges, a fully configurable content selection is available to the right of the display for functions such as navigation, trip computer, AcuraWatch™, maintenance, tire pressure, SH-AWD® status and a G-meter.

At an ultra-wide 12.3-inches, the full-HD display works seamlessly with the Acura-exclusive touchpad with \"absolute positioning\" and a new, more powerful CPU. The TTI in MDX features intuitive controls, including physical Power, Volume and Seek controls positioned within easy reach to the immediate right of the touchpad, along with more accurate swipe zones and handwriting recognition, as well as AI-driven Smart Shortcuts for quick and predictive access to common tasks.<br> <br> Integrated Dynamics System<br> <br> The MDX\'s Integrated Dynamics System offers Snow, Comfort, Normal, Sport and Individual settings. The control knob on the center of the dash enables drivers to quickly switch modes on the go, with each mode offering unique settings for engine and transmission performance including Idle Stop, steering settings, and SH-AWD® responsiveness when so equipped. The new Individual mode enables drivers to tailor their driving experience by customizing settings according to their personal preferences. With the Technology Package, the Integrated Dynamics System also includes Acura\'s IconicDrive™ interior lighting system, which illuminates the MDX cabin in 27 different selectable LED lighting schemes. Three are automatically aligned to the Comfort, Normal and Sport driving modes, with 24 additional user-selectable illuminations themed for iconic roads and race circuits around the world, such as Route 66 and Suzuka.<br> <br> Award Winning Audio<br> <br> The 2022 MDX will be offered with three different audio experiences. The MDX is equipped with a 9-speaker, 7-channel system with 350 watts standard. The MDX Technology Package gets an ELS Studio® system with 12 speakers, including an additional center speaker on the dash plus two new ceiling-mounted speakers, running 550 watts through 12 channels. On A-Spec and Advance Packages, the ELS STUDIO 3D® premium audio system features additional speakers in the third row plus two more ceiling-mounted speakers for a total of 16, with a total of 710 watts through 16 channels. Both ELS STUDIO® systems were tuned and perfected by eight-time Grammy® award-winning music producer and sound engineer, Elliot Scheiner, for whom the ELS system was named.<br> <br> Connectivity &amp; Charging<br> <br> A pop-up socket in the center console contains USB-C and USB-A charging ports in front of a convenient pocket for smartphones. Alternatively, with the addition of standard wireless Apple CarPlay® and Android Auto™ integration along with standard wireless charging through a Qi-compatible 15-watt charger located adjacent the TTI\'s palm rest, connecting and charging your phone is made even easier. The 2022 MDX also features Amazon Alexa Built-In, allowing drivers to ask Alexa to navigate to a specific address or point of interest, play music, make calls, listen to audiobooks, check the weather, control smart home devices, find parking, and more.<br> <br> New convenience features include standard CabinControl®, which enables passengers to control music, audio settings, rear climate controls, navigation and even the panoramic moonroof\'s sunshade position using a downloadable smartphone app. With A-Spec and Advance Packages, MDX features CabinTalk®, which amplifies the voices of front-seat passengers so they can be better heard in the second and third rows.<br> <br> The 2022 Acura MDX also features the latest generation of AcuraLink™, with in-vehicle 4GLTE Wi-Fi compatibility, over-the-air software update capability and a wide array of available cloud-based services, including emergency roadside assistance, remote locking/unlocking and engine start, stolen vehicle tracking, remote diagnostics, geofencing, speed tracking and Acura concierge services.<br> <br> Advanced Powertrain<br> <br> The 2022 Acura MDX debuts with an advanced 3.5-liter direct-injected i-VTEC™ V6 engine rated at 290 peak horsepower and 267 lb.-ft. peak torque (both SAE net). It incorporates a range of advanced friction-reducing technologies that help boost fuel efficiency and power output, and features a crossflow magnesium intake manifold, special \"tumble\" type intake ports, piston-crown shapes and an 11.5:1 compression ratio. The i-VTEC™ (intelligent Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) for the intake valves is combined with Variable Cylinder Management™ (VCM™) to widen the power band and maximize fuel efficiency. For the first time, the 2022 MDX applies an Active Shutter Grille. In certain conditions, shutters in the lower grille close to divert air around the vehicle, thereby reducing aerodynamic drag. When the demand for cooling air increases, the shutters reopen.<br> <br> For the first time, the 3.5-liter V6 in MDX is paired with Acura\'s 10-speed automatic transmission with Sequential SportShift and standard paddle shifters. The transmission offers a wider gear ratio range, more discrete gears, four-gear direct downshifts and lower first gear compared to the previous 9-speed automatic transmission.<br> <br> The 2022 MDX with front-wheel drive received an EPA rating of 19 mpg city/26 highway/22 combined, while MDX with Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ received an EPA rating of 19 mpg city/25 highway/21 combined.<br> <br> Torque Vectoring SH-AWD®<br> <br> The available rear-biased Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®) system for MDX uses Acura\'s industry-leading torque-vectoring all-wheel drive technology, and is offered as optional equipment on MDX and MDX with Technology Package. Now in its fourth generation, SH-AWD® has 40 percent more rear torque capacity and 30 percent quicker front-to-rear torque transfer than the third-generation system in the previous MDX. The Acura SH-AWD® system can transfer up to 70-percent of engine torque to the rear axle during normal driving conditions, while continuously apportioning up to 100 percent of that rear-axle torque between either the left or right rear wheels. The rear axle is continuously overdriven by 2.9-percent, which amplifies the yaw moment effect of left-to-right torque transfer, giving MDX even sharper and more accurate turn-in, with improved traceability when cornering.<br> <br> Advanced Safety and Driver-Assistive Technologies<br> <br> All 2022 Acura MDX trims will come standard with an expanded suite of AcuraWatch™ advanced safety and driver-assistive technologies. For 2022, AcuraWatch™ includes updated Road Departure Mitigation plus new technologies, such as Traffic Jam Assist (TJA), Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR), Pedestrian Detection and a new Driver Attention Monitor. Working in conjunction with Adaptive Cruise Control with Low Speed Follow, Traffic Jam Assist helps reduce driver stress in highly congested traffic situations by helping keep the vehicle in its lane and at a set interval behind a vehicle detected ahead. In addition, MDX will feature a new front and rear automatic braking system called Low Speed Braking Control. Included in the Technology Package, the new system uses the sonar-based parking sensors to sense solid objects at low speeds, such as in parking situations, and warn the driver or apply the brakes to help avoid or mitigate a collision.<br> <br> Next Generation Passenger Front Airbag<br> <br> Like the just-launched 2021 TLX, the new MDX features Acura\'s award-winning next-generation passenger front airbag technology. This new proprietary airbag uses a three-chamber design that functions much like a baseball catcher\'s mitt, designed to more effectively cradle and protect the front seat occupant\'s head to help mitigate potential injury, especially in angled frontal collisions.<br> <br> The 2022 Acura MDX also features the latest generation of Acura\'s Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure, with enhanced occupant and pedestrian collision protection capabilities. The new body structure improves overlap with smaller and lower-riding vehicles for improved collision compatibility, and features better absorption and distribution of crash loads around the passenger cabin. Side impact performance, assessed using the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety\'s side impact protocol, is further improved with a 34-percent reduction in cabin intrusion thanks to a redesigned ultra-high-strength side door ring and center roof pillar.<br> <br> The frontal area of the new MDX has been specifically designed with pedestrian safety in mind, with a deformable hood, hinge and upper fender combining with new lower and upper leg protection in the front fascia. Inside, MDX features new LATCH points for lower anchors and upper tethers, both redesigned to be more easily accessible.<br> <br> Safety Targets<br> <br> The 2022 MDX targets a 5-star Overall Vehicle Score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and incorporates anticipated future testing requirements, including oblique frontal collisions, pedestrian safety, and forward warning and automatic emergency braking tests. In addition, the new MDX targets a Top Safety Pick+ rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), including the highest available rating of GOOD in all collision tests and SUPERIOR for frontal crash prevention, with new headlights designed to achieve a GOOD rating in the rigorous IIHS headlight standard.<br> <br> Next to Arrive: High Performance MDX Type S<br> <br> Arriving at dealerships in late summer 2021, the Acura MDX Type S joins the lineup as the brand\'s first application of the Type S high performance nameplate to an SUV. MDX Type S will deliver an even stronger performance styling statement, with an open diamond mesh grille, quad exhaust outlets and gloss black trim replacing the standard chrome. Under the hood will be Acura\'s all-new 3.0-liter turbocharged DOHC V6 engine, producing an estimated 355 horsepower and 354 lb-ft of torque, coupled with Acura\'s SH-AWD®. Maximizing grip, the new MDX Type S will feature standard 21-inch wheels with 275-series tires, and additional braking power coming from larger brakes and 4-piston Brembo front calipers.<br> <br> Inside, Type S drivers will find even higher levels of refinement, with available 9-mode massaging front seats accented with curvilinear stitching, and colors and trim unique to Type S. A new \"Signature Edition\" ELS STUDIO 3D® premium audio system will be the most advanced and powerful audio system ever offered in an Acura vehicle, with more than 1,000 watts of power, 22 discrete channels and 25 speakers. More details on the highest-performing ever SUV from Acura will be released closer to its on-sale date late in the summer of 2021.<br> <br> Design, Development and Manufacturing<br> <br> The 2022 Acura MDX joins its three predecessors in being designed, engineered and developed in America. Styling was led by the Acura Design Studio in Torrance, Calif., while full platform development was led by engineers in the company\'s development center in Raymond, Ohio. The all-new MDX will continue to be built exclusively at the company\'s auto plant in East Liberty, Ohio, while both the 3.5-liter V6 and 3.0-liter VTEC® Turbo will be produced at the company\'s Anna, Ohio, engine plant, which also manufactures the NSX supercar\'s twin-turbocharged hybrid V6 power unit. Acura\'s 10-speed automatic transmission is built exclusively at the company\'s Tallapoosa, Ga., transmission plant.<br> <br>','[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_15.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_16.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_17.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_18.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_19.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_20.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_21.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_22.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_23.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_24.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_25.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_26.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_27.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_32.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_33.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_4.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_5.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_6.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_7.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_8.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_9.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_10.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_11.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_12.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_13.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_14.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_28.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_29.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_30.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-mdx-2021-6991_31.jpg\"]','2024-10-23 05:32:26','2024-10-23 05:32:26'),(12,'51f09b28','https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/acura-rdx-2021.html',2,'ACURA RDX 2021-Present Photos, engines &amp; full specs ','<p><strong>Acura introduced a facelift for the third generation of the RDX in 2021 as a model 2022, and it made it more dynamic than before.</strong></p><p></p><p>After more than half a million units sold between 2006 and 2021, the carmaker decided to give the RDX a bump to boost its sales, even though it was only two-year-old. While some changes added visual updates, there were others that improved the car’s handling. </p><p>The RDX was the most agile SUV in the carmaker’s stable, and it tried to match its performance with an adequate design. Its pentagonal grille featured thinner chromed surroundings and an option for LED fog lights. The car featured round exhausts at the back for the A-Spec model, while the rest of the range received rectangular ones. The carmaker installed 19,” or 20” light-alloy wheels with five, ten, or 15 spoke design.</p><p>For the interior, the most important changes were barely visible, but they included additional paddings on the ceiling, dashboard, and firewall.

Making its debut at the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach in striking Long Beach Blue Pearl paint, the 2022 RDX lineup is expanded with the availability of a new top trim, combining the sporty style of the highly popular RDX A-Spec with the premium features of the Advance Package. The 2022 RDX will begin arriving at Acura dealers nationwide in early November.</strong><br> <br> A hand-crafted limited-production 2022 RDX PMC Edition will be available at launch. Each 2022 RDX PMC Edition will be adorned exclusively in a stunning Long Beach Blue Pearl paint with Orchid Milano leather interior, both colors shared with the electrified 600-horsepower NSX Type S supercar. With production limited to just 200 units, it will be Acura\'s most exclusive PMC Edition yet.<br> <br> \"RDX has been an incredible success for Acura, with more than half a million sold since it was first introduced in 2006,\" said Emile Korkor, assistant vice president of Acura National Sales. \"The new 2022 RDX is the best it has ever been and further proof of Acura\'s commitment to deliver exciting premium performance products based on our unique DNA.\"<br> <br> RDX\'s turbocharged 272-horsepower 2.0-liter VTEC 4-cylinder is one of the most powerful standard engines in its class.

Acura\'s signature Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD) with true torque vectoring is available on all RDX grades and standard on the Advance Package and PMC Edition.<br> <br> Refined New Exterior Design<br> <br> Drawing inspiration from the fourth-generation Acura MDX, the Diamond Pentagon front grille of the 2022 Acura RDX features a new thinner, more sophisticated chrome surround. With broad aggressive forms and a larger air intake, its new front fascia also is similar to MDX and makes the RDX appear wider and more powerful. LED fog lights, which are standard on A-Spec and Advance Package models, as well as the PMC Edition, are highlighted by a new chrome trim.<br> <br> For a more distinct appearance from the rear, the 2022 RDX receives a reshaped rear fascia with cutouts for the new sophisticated rectangular dual exhaust finishers. The RDX A-Spec continues to standout with large-diameter round exhaust finishers in a gloss black finish.<br> <br> All RDX models come with either 19-inch or 20-inch alloy wheels. RDX features a 19-inch 10-spoke design standard, while RDX with Technology Package wears similar wheels with a machined face and Pewter Gray accents. The RDX with Advance Package features a sporty new 5-spoke machined finish 19-inch wheel design. RDX A-Spec models are equipped with 20-inch alloy wheels with Shark Gray finish.

Also new for the Advance Package equipped models are power-folding exterior mirrors.<br> <br> Most Premium RDX Cabin Ever<br> <br> For a more premium experience, the 2022 Acura RDX receives extensive updates to reduce road noise in the cabin. A new front fender liner reduces road noise and the Active Sound Control (ASC) system has been enhanced to further cancel exterior sounds from polluting the interior ambiance. The engine\'s cold idle speed also has been reduced from 1100 rpm to 950 rpm, and two-wheel drive models adopt a new lower torque rod to quell engine vibrations.<br> <br> Included with the Technology Package is a new, thicker carpet padding. The front doors receive a new sound insulator, plus acoustic glass to further reduce road and wind noise. A new and thicker noise insulation pad in the dash reduces engine noise further, and a new insulator in the D pillar further reduces road noise.<br> <br> Advance Package models feature the quietest cabin in RDX history. This is achieved with an additional sound insulator in the ceiling, and even more sound insulation added to the dash, under the hood and over the drivetrain tunnel. The rear doors also receive an insulator and acoustic glass. In the cargo area, the cargo bins now feature sound insulation, and the rear hatch inner covering has additional sound deadening materials.<br> <br> Genuine aluminum trim on the doors, dash and center console is standard on RDX. New for 2022 is an upscale and unique bronze finish applied to the aluminum, available exclusively on RDX models equipped with the Saddle Brown interior.

Contrast stitching has been added to the Ultrasuede® insert on the passenger side dash, and the door panels now feature new Ultrasuede® inserts. When equipped with the Red interior option, the door and center console arm rests are now keyed to the rest of the interior color. Also new for 2022 is an Orchid leather interior option, available exclusively on the A-Spec with Advance Package.<br> <br> Improved Driving Experience<br> <br> Refinements to Acura RDX\'s standard Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) noticeably improve the driving experience and allow the driver to better customize the SUV\'s dynamics to match a wider range of conditions. The updated system now features four more distinct drive modes (Normal, Comfort, Sport and Snow) which are selected by turning the Dynamic Mode Dial prominently mounted in the center of the dash.<br> <br> Each mode now features more distinct programming of the Electronic Power Steering (EPS), throttle and Active Sound Control (ASC). With the available Technology Package, the Integrated Dynamics System also changes the color of the IconicDrive™ LED ambient lighting. In addition, Acura has improved the 2022 RDX\'s brake pedal feel by retuning its Electronic Brake Booster (EBB).<br> <br> Advance Package models also feature an updated Adaptive Damper System (ADS) with more recognizable ride and handling characteristics across the four modes, improving both ride quality and response throughout the range.<br> <br> Normal Mode - In the default Normal mode, drivers experience an ideal balance between the ride comfort and isolation of Comfort mode and the responsive and sporty handling of Sport mode. Normal mode features a default white interior ambient lighting scheme.<br> <br> Comfort Mode - Retuned for a more relaxed driving experience, Comfort mode lightens the feel of the Electronic Power Steering and adjusts the throttle for smooth starts. The Active Sound Control minimizes engine sounds, and the ambient interior lighting defaults to a soothing blue. The ADS on Advance Package is tuned softer than before for a more comfortable and isolated ride without sacrificing body control.<br> <br> Sport Mode - The most aggressive setting, Sport mode tunes the EPS and throttle for more immediate response. For an even more thrilling driving experience, the ASC also has been retuned for a sportier engine sound, and the ambient interior lighting defaults to a sporty red. To improve handling, the RDX with Advance Package has been given new more aggressive ADS tuning, while the A-Spec® with Advance Package features its own unique ADS tuning to better match and maximize the performance of its 20-inch tires.<br> <br> Snow Mode - Snow mode uses a gentle throttle profile to help maintain traction in slippery conditions, and the softer suspension profile from Comfort mode.<br> <br> New Long Beach Blue PMC Edition<br> <br> The fifth Acura model to be built at Acura\'s Performance Manufacturing Center (PMC), the new 2022 RDX PMC Edition will be offered exclusively in vibrant Long Beach Blue Pearl paint. Shared only with the NSX supercar, the striking color salutes North America\'s most iconic street race - the Acura Grand Prix of Long Beach.

The PMC Edition rolls on Berlina Black 20-inch wheels with an elaborate 15-spoke design, and its large round exhaust outlets are finished in a unique dark chrome.<br> <br> Inside, all 2022 RDX PMC Editions feature the new Orchid interior color with blue contrast stitching to reflect the exclusive exterior color. Premium PMC Edition floor mats also are included. PMC Editions are contented with all available Advance Package premium features including the Head-Up Display (HUD), Surround View Camera, Rear Outboard Heated Seats, and 16-way power front seats with adjustable side bolsters.<br> <br> The assembly process of every RDX PMC Edition begins with the delivery of the body-in-white from the East Liberty Auto Plant which produces RDX. Once the five-day paint process is finished, the Acura\'s most skilled master technicians hand assemble each PMC Edition, which then undergo the same quality control process as the NSX before being wrapped in a specially designed car cover and transported to a dealer via an enclosed car carrier.<br> <br> Advanced Safety &amp; Driver Assistive Features<br> <br> Safety performance remains an RDX hallmark for 2022, with updates to safety technology and additional structure to improve crash performance to meet future standards.<br> <br> For 2022, blind spot information (BSI) driver assist system is standard on RDX and has been enhanced with the addition of a Lane Change Assist feature. The new system\'s detection range extends to nearly 100 feet (29.5 m) behind the vehicle, more than four times as far as before.<br> <br> Standard parking sensors on RDX with Technology Package are now utilized to integrate a new front and rear low-speed braking system. When the vehicle is driving forward or reversing between 1 and 6 mph, the system can detect objects in front of or behind the vehicle and assess if there is danger of a collision. Examples of detected objects include vehicles, utility poles, walls and even glass (such as storefront window). If an object is detected, the system provides visual and audible alerts, and applies throttle control and braking.<br> <br> Standard on every RDX, the AcuraWatch™ suite of safety and driver assistive technologies also gets an update. A new Traffic Sign Recognition system uses a camera, rather than GPS location, for more accurate speed limit information displayed on the 7-inch digital instrument screen and on the Head-Up Display (HUD) on Advance Package models. Additionally, the Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS™) with Forward Collision Warning (FCW) has been updated with Pedestrian AEB, which operates at speeds above 6 mph.<br> <br> Also standard on RDX for 2022 is a new rear seatbelt reminder system, which uses visual and audible cues to notify the driver if rear seat occupants have buckled their seatbelts.<br> <br> Targeting future crash safety targets, the 2022 RDX also features multiple new collision technologies. Rear passengers are now better protected in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) moderate overlap test thanks to new outboard seatbelts with pre-tensioning and load-limiting technology. Additional structure in the doors improves side impact collision performance, meeting the new SICE60 protocol.<br> <br> Design Engineering and Manufacturing<br> <br> Designed at the Acura Design Studio in Los Angeles, California, and developed in Raymond, Ohio, the third-generation Acura RDX marked the first time RDX was designed and developed in America. Like its predecessor, the 2022 RDX is manufactured in East Liberty, Ohio. The RDX\'s 2.0-liter VTEC® turbo engine is produced at the company\'s Anna, Ohio engine plant, while its new SH-AWD™ system is manufactured at the company\'s Russels Point, Ohio transmission plant, and the 10-speed automatic transmission is manufactured in the company\'s Tallapoosa, Georgia plant.<br> <br>','[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_20.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_21.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_22.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_23.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_24.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_25.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_26.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_27.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_28.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_29.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_30.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_31.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_32.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_33.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_34.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_35.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_36.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_37.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_38.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_39.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_40.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_41.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_42.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_43.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_44.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_4.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_5.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_6.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_7.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_8.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_9.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_10.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_11.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_12.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_13.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_14.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_15.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_16.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_17.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_18.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-rdx-2021-7172_19.jpg\"]','2024-10-23 05:32:27','2024-10-23 05:32:27'),(13,'692a5f76','https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/acura-tlx-2020.html',2,'ACURA TLX 2020-Present Photos, engines &amp; full specs ','<p><strong>No more drama and no more facelifted version for the Acura TLX since the Japanese premium car-maker brought a new sport-sedan in 2020.</strong></p><p></p><p>Acura introduced the first generation of the TLX was in 2014, and it was based on the same platform as the Honda Accord. The design elements were completely different, but they used the same engines. The second generation started from a blank sheet of paper, with a new platform,</p><p>The Acura TLX featured an angular design, with headlights that mimicked an angry samurai\'s eyes. With a pentagonal shaped grille and other air-intakes in the apron, the TLX looked aggressive. Sharp lines were designed on the sides and on the rear panel. The 2021 model was wider and longer than its predecessor. The headlights and taillights featured LED lamps.</p><p>Inside, due to its longer wheelbase by 3.7\" (94 mm), the TLX offered more legroom for the rear passengers. The middle seat was cramped due to the big center tunnel since it was available with an all-wheel-drive system as well. Acura fitted the front seats with up to 16-way adjustments to increase the front occupant\'s comfort. A new infotainment unit was developed, and it was Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatible.</p><p>For the drivetrain, the TLX was offered in various trim level. 2021 marked the return of the Type S version, which featured all-wheel-drive and adaptive damper settings. There were four engines available, and all of them were mated to automatic transmissions with 8, 9, or ten gears, depending on the engine.</p>','<strong>&nbsp;Acura revealed the quickest, best-handling and most well-appointed sedan in the brand\'s 35-year history - the all-new 2021 Acura TLX. With a model-exclusive body structure and chassis architecture, all turbo engine lineup, and an athletic stance with bold proportions, the new Acura TLX delivers dramatic gains in both style and dynamic performance. The first Acura sedan fully designed around the brand\'s Precision Crafted Performance ethos, the 2021 TLX will arrive at dealerships in early fall 2020 with a manufacturer suggested retail price (MSRP) starting in the mid-$30,000 range.</strong><br> <br> The second-generation Acura TLX also marks the highly anticipated return of Acura\'s Type S high performance variant after a decade-long hiatus. The TLX Type S, arriving next spring, will be powered by an all-new Acura exclusive 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine developed for Type S levels of performance. Additionally, the new TLX Type S will be the first Type S model to feature Acura\'s torque vectoring Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®) system, making it the best handling and most performance-oriented Acura sedan yet.<br> <br> In fulfilling its mission as a thoroughly modern sport sedan, the 2021 TLX integrates a multitude of performance, comfort and connectivity technologies first deployed on the highly successful third-generation Acura RDX. These include a high-output 2.0-liter VTEC® turbocharged engine, 4th-generation SH-AWD® system, award-winning Acura ELS STUDIO 3D® premium audio and the latest iteration of Acura\'s driver-focused True Touchpad Interface™.<br> <br> \"With this new TLX, we\'re doubling down on what today\'s sport sedan enthusiasts are asking for - a more stylish, personal and performance-focused driving experience,\" said Jon Ikeda, vice president and Acura brand officer. \"Our designers and engineers really took the gloves off, rethinking what an Acura sport sedan should be, right down to its most essential elements - stance, proportion, platform and powertrain. This is unquestionably our most ambitious redesign of an Acura sedan.\"<br> <br> Next-Generation Design<br> <br> The 2021 Acura TLX features an athletic and powerful exterior design with proportions, stance and silhouette heavily influenced by the Acura Precision Concept and faithfully translated from the Type S Concept. The new TLX\'s performance intentions are conveyed through its low and wide stance, long dash-to-axle ratio, expansive hood, tapered greenhouse and pronounced rear haunches. Relative to the previous model, the new TLX features a 3.7-inch longer wheelbase, 2.2-inch wider body with wider front and rear tracks (+1.2 in. and +1.6 in., respectively), lower roof (-0.6 in.) and an extended dash-to-axle dimension (+7.8 in.).<br> <br> At the front, a bolder and more upright diamond pentagon grille is flanked by signature, next-generation Acura lighting cues previewed in the Type S Concept. These include new Jewel Eye® LED headlights with four LED elements and bright-white \"Chicane\" LED daytime running lights inspired by the championship-winning Acura ARX-05 Daytona Prototype race car.<br> <br> The sedan\'s sleek and dynamic side profile uses sheer, angled surfaces to create strong light-and-shadow contrasts and to accentuate the sedan\'s muscular rear wheel arches, which lead into a rear section featuring a shorter overhang, upswept rear decklid, \"Chicane\" LED taillights and exposed dual exhaust outlets.<br> <br> The neatly tailored cabin section is set farther back on the body and features more steeply inward-sloping roof pillars to further emphasize the TLX\'s muscular low and wide stance. The roof itself has been sculpted with a lower-set center section, defined by two inward curving grooves, for a more distinctive look that conveys a sense of movement and lower appearance.<br> <br> A-Spec: Sport Package<br> <br> Acura\'s highly popular A-Spec sport package continues, adding distinctive sport appearance upgrades inside and out. Unique exterior A-Spec features includes Shark Grey 19-inch wheels, gloss black accents front to rear, darkened headlight and taillight treatment, and a pronounced rear decklid spoiler.<br> <br> Type S: High Performance Variant<br> <br> Arriving spring 2021, the Acura TLX Type S builds upon the A-Spec styling elements, elevating TLX\'s sporty appearance even further. At the front, a unique open-surface Diamond Pentagon grille and larger side air intakes feed an all-new powerful V6 turbo engine developed for Acura Type S models. Aerodynamic elements include a rear decklid spoiler, aggressive front splitter and rear diffuser, and large quad exhaust outlets that harken back to the 2007-2008 TL Type S. Two exclusive 20-inch wheels designs will be offered, a split-10 spoke design from the Type S Concept and an NSX-inspired lightweight \"Y-Spoke\" wheel, both wrapped in 255-series performance rubber. More details on the TLX Type S will be released closer to its on-sale date in the Spring of 2021.<br> <br> Exclusive New Body and Chassis<br> <br> The 2021 TLX is a sport sedan at its core, built on a new dedicated Acura sedan platform designed for Type S-levels of performance. The new chassis heralds the return of double-wishbone front suspension to Acura\'s top-selling sedan, offering more precise handling and cornering grip, as well as greater mechanical compliance for improved ride quality. In addition, the TLX chassis incorporates multiple new performance-focused engineering upgrades, including a variable-ratio steering system, electro-servo brake-by-wire technology applied from the NSX and an available driver selectable Adaptive Damper System.<br> <br> The Acura TLX\'s all-new chassis is anchored to an advanced new body structure - NSX aside, the most rigid ever offered on an Acura vehicle- delivering a 50 percent increase in global torsional stiffness and up to a 100 percent improvement in localized rigidity where the suspension is mounted to the body. The new structure uses 56 percent (by weight) advanced, lightweight materials, including aluminum and press-hardened steel, more than any previous Acura sedan.<br> <br> An ultra-rigid new center tunnel serves as the backbone of the TLX\'s higher structural rigidity, complimented by triangulated front shock tower bars, front and rear underfloor braces, a one-piece rear bulkhead stiffener and new cast-aluminum front shock tower mounts. Front-to-rear weight balance is also improved by an extensive use of aluminum, including the front bumper, hood, front fenders and front damper mounts, in addition to locating the 12-volt battery in the trunk.<br> <br> NSX Electro-Servo Brakes<br> <br> First developed for the second-generation NSX, the new TLX utilizes a highly sophisticated electric-servo brake system. This system allowed Acura engineers to finely tune the brake pedal force and electronically control the brake pressure to optimize the vehicle\'s performance driving characteristics.<br> <br> For the TLX Type S, multiple hardware upgrades will improve braking performance, including larger discs and four-piston Brembo® front calipers complemented by performance-focused tuning of the entire braking system.<br> <br> Wheels and Tires<br> <br> The Acura TLX\'s athletic stance is grounded by larger standard 18-inch (+1-in.) wheels and available 19-inch wheels in various finishes, depending on trim. Performance-tuned 255-series rubber provides 20 percent more lateral grip than the outgoing tires.<br> <br> TLX Type S models will be equipped with 20-inch split-10 spoke alloy wheels finished in Shark Gray. An optional lightweight wheel inspired by the NSX \"Y-spoke\" design will be offered alongside a high-performance summer tire, further increasing grip while reducing unsprung mass.<br> <br> Two High-Output Turbo Powertrains<br> <br> The new TLX will offer two, powerful and high-torque turbocharged engines.<br> <br> Standard power comes from a 2.0-liter DOHC, direct-injected and turbocharged engine with VTEC, mated to Acura\'s incredibly responsive 10-speed automatic transmission with Sequential SportShift. With peak output of 272 horsepower and 280 lb.-ft. of torque (SAE Net), the TLX\'s 2.0-liter turbo boasts the highest horsepower in its core competitive set, delivering dramatic gains in horsepower (+66) and torque (+98 lb.-ft. at peak, +123 lb.-ft. at 1,500 rpm) when compared to the previous model\'s naturally aspirated 2.4-liter 4-cylinder. Compared to the previous TLX\'s optional 3.5-liter V6, the new 2.0-liter turbo delivers an additional 13 lb.-ft. of peak torque, as well as an additional 48 lb.-ft. at 1,500 rpm.<br> <br> When it arrives in spring 2021, the Acura TLX Type S will deliver power from an all-new 3.0-liter, 24-valve, DOHC direct-injected and turbocharged engine developed by some of the company\'s most experienced powertrain engineers, including members of the team that developed the NSX\'s bespoke twin-turbocharged V6 hybrid power unit. The new transverse-mounted V6 will be highly compact and lightweight, utilizing a dual scroll turbocharger and electronic wastegate to deliver immediate, high-torque response. Compared to the outgoing, naturally aspirated 3.5-liter V6, the new engine delivers dramatic gains in peak horsepower and, more critically, in torque, across the engine\'s full operating range, including a more than 50-percent increase in low-end torque. Final specifications for the new engine, including power output, will be released closer to launch timing.<br> <br> Acura\'s 10-speed automatic, with Sequential SportShift and standard paddle shifters, takes full advantage of both turbocharged engines\' high-torque output, offering a wider ratio range, more discrete gears, four-gear direct downshifts and a lower first gear compared to the previous 8-speed dual-clutch and 9-speed automatic transmissions. Type S models will receive unique transmission tuning to provide an aggressive and responsive characteristic during performance driving scenarios.<br> <br> Torque Vectoring SH-AWD®<br> <br> Superior handling capabilities are now offered on all TLX models with the available rear-biased Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®), Acura\'s industry-leading torque-vectoring all-wheel drive technology. SH-AWD is offered as optional equipment on the 2.0-liter TLX and as standard technology on the TLX Type S, the first Type S model to feature all-wheel drive.<br> <br> Acura\'s 4th-generation SH-AWD® system has 40 percent more rear torque capacity and 30 percent quicker front-to-rear torque transfer than the 3rd-generation system in the outgoing TLX. The Acura SH-AWD® system in the new TLX transfers up to 70 percent of engine torque to the rear axle during normal driving conditions, while continuously apportioning up to 100 percent of that rear-axle torque between either the left and right rear wheels. Additionally, the rear axle is continuously overdriven by 2.9 percent, which amplifies the yaw moment effect of left-to-right torque transfer, elevating performance through sharper and more accurate turn-in, and improved traceability when cornering.<br> <br> Driver-focused, Premium Cockpit Design<br> <br> The 2021 Acura TLX\'s more premium, personal and tech-focused cabin takes inspiration from the Acura Precision Cockpit\'s intuitive functionality and flowing lines. Designed around the desires of today\'s luxury sport sedan enthusiasts, the TLX is tastefully appointed with available authentic, high-grade materials including real aluminum, open-pore wood and full-grain Milano leather.<br> <br> Developed under the theme of \"Dual Personal Cockpit,\" the sedan\'s new, more luxurious interior places a strong emphasis on the driver and front-seat passenger. The TLX\'s high and wide center tunnel and wrap-around instrument panel create a more personal and strongly delineated space for both front-seat occupants, while its wider body design enables true first-class seating comfort for both, with top-of-class hip and shoulder room (+0.5 in. and +0.7 in., respectively).<br> <br> Both the driver and front passenger also benefit from the tailored design of Acura\'s advanced front sport seats, highly customizable with up to 16-way power adjustability. For the driver, a stout leather-wrapped steering wheel, clean and clear instrumentation, and improved forward visibility serve as the foundations for an in-command and exhilarating driving experience.<br> <br> A-Spec and Type S models feature unique details throughout the cabin, including a thick-rimmed, flat-bottom steering wheel wrapped in perforated leather with contrast stitching and larger metal-plated paddle shifters. In addition to unique materials and colors, the TLX Type S interior is distinguished by Type S badging on the door sills, steering wheel and embossed headrests.<br> <br> Intuitive Technology and Connectivity<br> <br> The 2021 Acura TLX also incorporates a full array of Acura technologies designed for enhanced comfort, connectivity and audio entertainment, starting with a new implementation of Acura\'s innovative and driver-oriented True Touchpad Interface™. This system features a high-mounted 10.2-inch HD display and a console mounted touchpad with \"Absolute Position\" mapping.

The available award winning Acura ELS STUDIO 3D® premium audio system features four ultra-slim Highline™ ceiling-mounted speakers as well as a new Twin Telford™ subwoofer design.<br> <br> The new TLX also features the latest generation of AcuraLink™ with in-vehicle 4GLTE Wi-Fi, over-the-air software update capability and a wide array of available cloud-based services, including emergency roadside assistance, remote locking/unlocking and engine start, stolen vehicle tracking, remote diagnostics, geofencing, speed tracking and Acura concierge services.<br> <br> Color and Trims<br> <br> The new TLX will feature an expanded color palette with nine exterior finishes including five premium colors. New to the TLX for 2021 is a distinguished Phantom Violet Pearl. The TLX Type S will be offered in an exclusive, bold Tiger Eye Pearl. Apex Blue Pearl, previously available only on A-Spec models, will be added to the Type S catalog.<br> <br> A total of seven interior color options will be offered on the 2021 TLX. Ebony, Espresso, Graystone and Parchment will be offered on the standard TLX models, depending on trim. TLX A-Spec and TLX Type S models will feature either Ebony or Red Leather, both with black Ultrasuede® inserts. Additionally, the TLX Type S will offer an exclusive Light Orchid leather interior option.<br> <br> Further enhancing the driving environment, the new TLX features available ambient LED lighting throughout the cabin. The new system provides a unique interior ambient lighting scheme that changes with each driving mode (Comfort, Normal, Sport), as well as 24 selectable interior lighting schemes, each named after an iconic performance driving destination or track, such as \"Pacific Coast\" and \"Suzuka\".<br> <br> Customizable Driving Performance<br> <br> The 2021 Acura TLX provides for a more versatile and personalized driving experience through the use of Acura\'s Integrated Dynamics System, now featuring an Individual Mode. As before, the system integrates a multitude of powertrain and chassis systems, accessed via the drive mode dial prominently positioned on the center console.

The carmaker entirely made its design in the U.S., and that was a big step forward. It also showcased the trend for future Acura products.</p><p>From the outside, the grille looked dynamic. Besides its watermelon-sized badge, the grille sported a 3D mesh that looked like Star Trek warp lines. Its angular Jewel Eye headlights used seven LEDs instead of five as on its predecessor. The raked windshield continued with a slightly sloped-down roofline ended into a raked-forward windscreen in the back. </p><p>Inside, the carmaker installed an NSX-inspired instrument panel with two large dials that flanked a center LCD and two digital gauges for the fuel level and coolant temperature. On top of the center stack, Honda installed a 10.2\" full-HD center display accessed via a touch-pad mounted high atop the center console. Fortunately, the carmaker used a physical volume turn-knob on the driver\'s side. The high-bolstered front bucket seats provided good support while high-speed cornering, while the flat-folding rear bench increased the trunk size from 28.9 cu-ft (818 liters) to a cavernous 58.9 cu-ft (1,668 liters) with the seatback folded.</p><p>Under the hood, the carmaker installed a 2.0-liter turbocharged unit paired to the SH-AWD system via a ten-speed automatic gearbox.</p>','<strong>&nbsp;The 2019 Acura RDX debuted at the 2018 New York International Auto Show. As the first in a new generation of Acura products, the re-engineered 2019 RDX delivers top-of-class performance, a more spacious and luxurious cabin, and a host of premium technology and features. Designed, developed and manufactured in America, the new turbocharged RDX will launch mid-2018 as the quickest, best handling and most luxurious Acura RDX yet.</strong><br> <br> \"The 2019 Acura RDX signals the start of a new era for the Acura brand by delivering design, performance and prestige that will elevate its position in the luxury market\'s fastest growing segment,\" said Henio Arcangeli, Jr., senior vice president of the Automobile Division of American Honda Motor Co., Inc. \"This RDX is our most extensive redesign in more than a decade, a truly ground up reimagining of the RDX around our Precision Crafted Performance brand direction.\"<br> <br> Acura also debuted the 2019 Acura RDX A-Spec sport appearance variant - distinguished by larger wheels, gloss black accents and unique interior treatment including an available two-tone red and black interior. With the addition of A-Spec to both the RDX and MDX, Acura has fulfilled its commitment to expand A-Spec to all core models.<br> <br> Sharp, Low and Wide Design<br> <br> The production 2019 RDX carries forward substantially all of the design cues that debuted with the Prototype RDX in January 2018. In creating the new RDX, Acura designers worked from the foundations of the Acura Precision Concept, adapting its low and wide stance, sleek presence and wheels-out proportions to a five-passenger SUV.<br> <br> <br> The 2089 Acura RDX showcases Acura\'s signature Diamond Pentagon Grille flanked by all-new Jewel Eye™ headlights - now boasting seven LED light elements, up from the previous five. Below, wide air intakes include NSX-inspired air curtains feed air efficiently around the front wheels and down the body side. Prominent hood bulges are visible from inside the cabin, signaling the performance character of the third-generation RDX.<br> <br> Sharp character lines accentuate the front and rear fenders, with an aggressive \"dropping\" character line running the length of the RDX. A pen stroke of chrome (gloss-black on A-Spec) highlights the upper greenhouse and lower rocker. At the rear, the design of the 2019 RDX is capped off with a distinctive \"dragon tail\" LED light signature of the taillights.<br> <br> New Acura-Exclusive Body and Chassis Architecture<br> <br> The 2019 Acura RDX sits atop an all-new body and chassis architecture designed to deliver a sophisticated and engaging driving experience. It starts with a 2.6 inch longer wheelbase, which aids both ride comfort and cabin space. The cargo area behind the rear seats has expanded 3.4-cubic feet with an additional 1.7 cubic-feet of compartmented underfloor storage. The new platform provides for a fully-flat rear floor, enabling first-class seating comfort in all three rear seating positions.<br> <br> The RDX\'s body structure is composed of over 50 percent high strength steel. It utilizes a new double-ring rear frame design and new two-piece ultra-high-strength steel front door rings, which significantly increase body rigidity, handling precision and cabin quietness.<br> <br> The body structure is mated to an all-new chassis design with variable ratio dual-pinion electric power steering, a sport-tuned Macpherson strut front suspension, an all-new five-link independent rear suspension and available adaptive dampers.<br> <br> VTEC Turbo Engine with Higher Performance and Efficiency<br> <br> The new Acura RDX takes power from a direct-injected and turbocharged 2.0-liter, 16-valve powerplant with DOHC VTEC® valvetrain and Dual Variable Timing Cam (Dual VTC). Peak output is 272 horsepower and 280 lb.-ft. of torque. Compared to the previous model\'s V6, peak torque is up 28 lb.-ft. and available across a wider section of the power band, from 1,600 to 4,500 rpm (previously 252 lb.-ft. at 4,900 rpm) with low-RPM torque boosted by as much as 40 percent for quicker acceleration and sharper throttle response.<br> <br> Segment-first 10-Speed Transmission<br> <br> The RDX\'s turbocharged engine is paired with a 10-speed automatic transmission (10AT) - the first and only 10AT in the class. With more closely spaced ratios and a 62 percent wider ratio range, Acura\'s 10AT takes full advantage of the turbo engine\'s bountiful low-end torque. Gear changes are quick and seamless, in both automatic mode and using steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters.<br> <br> Return of Torque Vectoring SH-AWD<br> <br> The third generation redesign also marks the return of torque-vectoring Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®) to RDX, in its most powerful and sophisticated form ever. In addition to improving all-wheel-drive performance, Acura\'s SH-AWD utilizes dynamic torque vectoring to sharpen handling response and deliver vivid, exhilarating and confidence-inspiring driving performance in virtually all weather and road conditions.<br> <br> With Acura\'s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive, up to 70% of torque can be distributed to the rear wheels. And up to 100% of that torque can be distributed to either the right-rear or left-rear wheel, creating incredible control and agility. The 2019 RDX is the first model to utilize this new generation of Acura SH-AWD.<br> <br> Spacious, Luxurious and Tech-forward Cabin<br> <br> The 2019 RDX\'s sumptuously appointed, tech-forward and spacious new cabin features Acura\'s latest thinking for a more premium, personal and connected driving experience.<br> <br> Exceptional seating comfort is provided by next-generation Acura sport seats, designed exclusively for RDX and future Acura products. The new, more intricately sculpted sport seats feature a lightweight ultra-high-strength steel frame, with improved lateral support for spirited driving and up to 16-way power adjustability. In all grades, the RDX provides both the driver and front-seat passenger the same levels of seating adjustability and comfort.<br> <br> The Acura RDX\'s new ultra-wide panoramic moonroof, standard on all grades, has power slide and tilt functions and a power sliding sunshade. It is among the largest and widest in the class providing an open and airy feeling throughout the cabin.<br> <br> Available authentic high-grade materials are featured throughout the cabin, including brushed aluminum, stainless steel, open pore Olive Ash wood trim, Ultrasuede® and rich Milano leather.<br> <br> Inspired by the NSX, a high-deck floating center console and prominent Integrated Dynamics System control knob allows drivers to quickly switch between four distinct drive modes (Snow, Comfort, Sport and Sport+).<br> <br> Intuitive True Touchpad Interface™<br> <br> Designed from a clean sheet and deployed for the first time in the automotive world in the third generation RDX, Acura\'s True Touchpad Interface is a holistic, system-level approach to in-car user interface that is optimized for the driver and the driving experience.<br> <br> The system is designed to combine the advantages of both conventional touchscreen and remote-based approaches. The True Touchpad Interface features a 10.2-inch full-HD center display mounted high atop the center console, close to the driver\'s natural line of sight, a center console-mounted touchpad and an all-new, Android-based operating system.<br> <br> Unlike conventional touchpad designs, Acura\'s True Touchpad Interface does not require the user to locate a cursor on the screen while navigating the touchpad. To support intuitive and easy control, the touchpad is precisely mapped, one-to-one, with the action on the center display - the world\'s first application of absolute positioning in the driving environment. Simply, a touch on any location of the touchpad corresponds directly with that same location on the display.<br> <br> Further supporting ease of use, the touchpad\'s surface is slightly concave, allowing the user to quickly identify the center of the touchpad without looking down. A padded wrist rest, integrated within the RDX\'s high-deck floating center console, provides a comfortable and stable platform for operating the touchpad.<br> <br> The operating system features simple, clean graphics and menu structures designed in concert with the touchpad. It features two zones, a larger primary zone, and smaller secondary zone, allowing for easy viewing and one-tap swapping of primary and secondary functions - navigation and music, for example.<br> <br> Acura ELS Studio 3D™ Audio<br> <br> The new Acura RDX also marks the debut of Acura ELS Studio 3D premium audio, a 16-channel, 710-watt system featuring four ultra-slim Highline™ ceiling-mounted speakers - available on high grades. Developed by Acura and Panasonic and tuned by Grammy-winning music producer, Elliot Schiener, Acura ELS Studio 3D audio delivers incredible fidelity and dynamic range while adding a new dimension of sound to the listening experience.<br> <br> Head-Up Display and Natural Language Voice Recognition<br> <br> Another Acura first is a new natural language voice recognition system, which allows for more intuitive voice control of major features and functions, including commands for the available embedded Acura Navigation System. Also new is an available 10.5-inch full-color interactive Head-Up Display, which puts customizable information displays, including audio, phone, AcuraWatch alerts, turn-by-turn navigation and more directly in the driver\'s line of sight.<br> <br> A-Spec Variant Boosts Sport Appearance<br> <br> The new Acura RDX A-Spec, the first-ever Acura SUV with A-Spec treatment, adds distinctive sport appearance upgrades inside and out. Shark Gray 20-inch alloy wheels shod with low-profile 255/45R20 tires create a more athletic stance and are complemented by a unique lower front fascia and gloss-black accents for the front grille, Jewel Eye™ headlights, side sills, upper window sash and taillights. LED fog lights, large-diameter dual exhaust finishers and A-Spec badging on the front quarter panels and tailgate complete the exterior package.<br> <br> Inside, the RDX A-Spec features exclusive sports seats wrapped in either black or red leather with black premium Ultrasuede® inserts and contrasting stitching. Real aluminum decorates the center-console, doors and instrument panel, with additional soft-touch Ultrasuede on the dash. The A-Spec\'s stitched leather sport steering wheel features gloss black trim, metal-plated paddle shifters and A-Spec badging. A unique driver\'s gauge cluster gets an A-Spec exclusive satin silver finish with red-illuminated nighttime readouts.<br> <br> Unparalleled Standard Features, Value<br> <br> The 2019 RDX boasts an extensive and class-leading array of premium features and technologies as standard equipment, including 19-inch alloy wheels, next-generation Acura Jewel Eye™ LED headlights, an ultra-wide panoramic moonroof, a power operated and height adjustable tailgate, Acura True Touchpad Interface™ with 10.2-inch HD Display, Apple CarPlay™ compatibility, Smart Entry and Smart Start, AcuraLink™ Connected Services with 4G LTE in-car Wi-Fi, 12-way heated driver and passenger sport seats, four-mode Integrated Dynamics System and AcuraWatch™ safety and driver-assistive technology.<br> <br> Top Active and Passive Safety Tech<br> <br> The 2019 Acura RDX is designed to provide high levels of both active and passive safety. All models and grades come standard with the full suite of AcuraWatch safety and driver assist technologies, including Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS™) with Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Road Departure Mitigation (RDM) with Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low-Speed Follow and Lane Keeping Assist (LKAS).<br> <br> Utilizing the latest generation of Acura\'s Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure along with advanced supplemental restraint systems, including front and front side airbags, front knee airbags, side curtain airbags, pretensioning seatbelts and Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren (LATCH) child-seat anchors, the 2019 RDX targets top NCAP 5-star Overall Vehicle Score and an IIHS TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating.<br> <br> Designed, Developed and Manufactured in America<br> <br> The third-generation Acura RDX is the first RDX to be designed and developed in America. Styling design of the RDX was conducted by the Acura Design Studio in Los Angeles, California, with development undertaken by the company\'s North American R&amp;D team, based in Raymond, Ohio. The new RDX will be manufactured in East Liberty, Ohio, with its 2.0-liter turbo engine produced in the company\'s Anna, Ohio engine plant and its 10-speed automatic transmission manufactured at the company\'s Tallapoosa, Georgia plant.','[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_18.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_19.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_20.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_21.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_22.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_23.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_24.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_25.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_26.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_27.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_38.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_39.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_40.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_41.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_42.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_43.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_44.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_45.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_46.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_47.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_48.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_49.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_50.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_51.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_52.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_53.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_54.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_55.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_56.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_57.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_58.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_59.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_60.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_61.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_62.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_63.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_64.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_4.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_5.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_6.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_7.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_8.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_9.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_10.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_11.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_12.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_13.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_14.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_15.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_16.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_17.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_28.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_29.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_30.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_31.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6303_32.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/im

Their L-shaped turn-signals and the 3D mesh-grille design were far from the knight-visor from its predecessor, and that was a good thing. On the lower side of the bumper, the carmaker added a broad black grille that covered the apron and included the fake side-scoops that hosted the fog lights. </p><p>Inside, the carmaker used the same combo of analog dials and TFT displays for the instrument cluster, similar to the one used in the TSX sedan.

The Legend was a very appreciated vehicle worldwide, whether it sported the Honda or the Acura badge. Moreover, the RLX was sold as Honda Legend in Japan. Meanwhile, technology evolved, and the Japanese carmaker improved its skills in creating hybrid sports vehicles, such as the NSX. As a result, some of the ideas met on the 2018 model-year RLX were carried over from that car.</p><p>Up front, the RLX sported the new design language made by Acura and seen on the MDX model. Its grille featured a 3D pattern with lines and dots that converged to the center towards the Acura chromed badge. A chromed trim surrounded it, and, in addition, more chromed elements were added to the lower bumper around the side scoops. The diamond-inspired look of the headlights featured LED lamps with adaptive lighting. From its profile, the RLX looked more like a sports sedan than a regular, mid-size one. In addition, the carmaker added a few more chromed trims at the back around the side exhausts and on the trunk\'s lid.</p><p>Inside, the carmaker listened to the critics who said that the interior was not as luxurious or didn\'t provide such a premium feel as some of its competitors. Thus, Acura introduced a higher quality leather upholstery, new wood trims, and seats. </p><p>Under the hood, Acura offered a choice of two drivetrains. The base version featured a 3.5-liter V6 that sent the power to the front wheels via a ten-speed automatic. At the same time, the top model received a 377 hp (382 PS) hybrid powerplant that sent its torque in all corners via a seven-speed automatic.</p>','<strong>Acura unveiled a redesigned 2018 Acura RLX reflecting the brand\'s new Precision Crafted Performance design direction to create a more substantial presence for Acura\'s top-of-the-line luxury sports sedan.

Depending on the market, Honda sold it under the Acura or the Honda badge, even though the main difference between them was the speedometer marked in kilometers per hour or miles per hour, respectively. But, since both versions sported a digital display, it was just a matter of software setting.</p><p>Like its predecessor, the 2016 NSX was a mid-engined car with a short nose. The styling, on the other hand, was completely different. Its angular front fascia sported slim LED headlights and a pentagonal-shaped grille flanked by broad side scoops. From its profile, the greenhouse sported an arched roofline that sloped down to the back of the vehicle, covering the engine compartment. In front of the rear wheel arches, the automaker installed the air intakes needed to cool the engine and feed it with air. Finally, at the back, Honda\'s design team installed LED taillights linked with a red strip.</p><p>Despite the sporty exterior look, the cabin was luxurious. Even though it featured high-bolstered seats, these provided both comfort and side support. Between the car\'s occupants, the automaker installed a tall center console that hosted the buttons for the gearbox. There wasn\'t any shift lever or gear selector. Fronting the driver was a TFT that showed the speedometer in digits inside the round tachometer.</p><p>But the real magic of the car happened under its skin, where a pair of electric motors drove the front wheels while a third motor helped the turbocharged V6 placed behind the cabin. Thus, the NSX proved to be not just fast but also fuel efficient.</p>','<strong>Twenty-five years after the debut of the original, paradigm-shifting NSX supercar, Acura revealed the production version of its highly anticipated successor—the next-generation Acura NSX, developed and produced in the U.S.—to the world\'s auto media at the 2015 North American International Auto Show. The production model, in a scintillating NSX Red finish, took the stage with a growl from its twin-turbocharged engine.</strong><br> <br> The next generation NSX showcases the production styling, design and specifications of Acura\'s mid-engine sports hybrid supercar, and Acura announced key details of the all-new vehicle\'s design and performance. The company will begin accepting custom orders for the new NSX starting in the summer, with customer deliveries expected later in the year.<br> <br> Specifically created to bring a \"new sports experience\" to the supercar segment, the NSX challenges conventional beliefs about supercars — much as the first generation did a quarter century ago. The approach is realized through an all-new power unit—a twin-turbocharged 75-degree DOHC V6 engine with a 9-speed dual clutch transmission (DCT) and three-electric motor Sport Hybrid system—integrated with an ultra-rigid and lightweight multi-material body with world\'s-first material applications and manufacturing processes. Developed under the concept of a \"human-centered supercar,\" a car that puts the driver first in every aspect of its design, the next-generation NSX will leverage its state-of-the-art hybrid supercar power unit, body and chassis to deliver exceptionally intuitive and immediate response to driver inputs.<br> <br> \"Our commitment was to create an all-new NSX that is true to the heritage of NSX—a supercar that delivers a new driving experience, one where every part of the vehicle is respectful of the smartest part of the car, the driver,\" said Mike Accavitti, senior vice president and general manager of the Acura division. \"The soul of a car is the emotional connection it makes with the driver. With the NSX, that connection will be intense and immediate.\"<br> <br> As the pinnacle representation of Acura performance and prestige, the NSX was introduced at the auto show under the theme of \"Precision Crafted Performance.\" The theme was the original tagline for the Acura brand, a guiding force behind the development of the original NSX and a critical component of its launch.<br> <br> The development of next-generation NSX, driven by precision crafted performance, has resulted in a clean-sheet design, which involved nearly three years of intensive development effort by a global design and engineering team led by engineers at the company\'s development center in Raymond, Ohio.<br> <br> \"The NSX reflects Acura\'s American roots and makes a powerful statement about the strong role being played by our North American operations in envisioning and building the future of Acura,\" said Erik Berkman, executive vice president of the Acura Business Planning Office. \"Our global team embraced the challenge to create a new sports car experience, leveraging new technology to deliver incredibly vivid performance in a vehicle that responds intuitively and immediately to the will of the driver,\" said Ted Klaus, chief engineer and global development leader of the new NSX. \"The NSX delivers pinnacle supercar performance, with zero-delay acceleration and exhilarating, confidence-inspiring driving dynamics.\"<br> <br> <strong>Interwoven Dynamic Exterior Design</strong><br> <br> \"The new NSX is a product of what we term \'Interwoven Dynamic\' design,\" said Michelle Christensen, NSX exterior design project leader. \"It represents the ideal blending of exotic sports car form and supercar function.\"<br> <br> The NSX body features classic low and wide proportions married to modern and alluring surfacing, an aggressive front design, and tail lights that pays homage to the original NSX. The signature side intake and floating C-pillar collects air to feed the mid-mounted engine and directs airflow over the rear deck to increase downforce. To accommodate the new longitudinally mounted twin-turbo V6 and 9-speed DCT, the production vehicle was lengthened (+3 inches) and widened (+1 inch) with a slightly more cab-forward package, compared with the proportions of the NSX Concept shown in 2012.<br> <br> Every element of the exterior body design has been carefully fashioned for total airflow management for both stability-enhancing downforce and vehicle systems cooling. The NSX has undergone extensive testing at the company\'s state-of-the-art wind tunnel in Raymond, Ohio, leading to a number of significant changes from concept to final body design, including modified hood vents, new front fender vents, modified side air intakes, and an optimized deck spoiler.<br> <br> <strong>Human Support Cockpit</strong><br> <br> \"Consistent with the \'human-centered supercar\' development concept, the NSX was designed from the inside out with an uncompromising focus on the driver,\" said Johnathan Norman, NSX interior design project leader. \"Like the original NSX, we created a \'Human Support Cockpit\' that provides exceptional driver control, visibility and packaging, but further advanced to meet the extreme performance expectations of a modern supercar.\"<br> <br> The NSX interior boasts exceptional forward visibility, simple and intuitive controls, and class-leading ergonomics—most notably the seat, which features top-class holding performance with outstanding comfort and easy ingress/egress.<br> <br> The NSX\'s instrument cluster features a dynamic TFT display that responds to changes in the driver-selectable Integrated Dynamics System with pertinent graphics and information. The center console holds the Power button that readies the sport hybrid powertrain, nested in the center of the new Integrated Dynamics System dial control. Interwoven under the handcrafted leather dash panel is the exposed midframe—a functioning chassis structural member that reflects the design aesthetic of a naked sport bike. An ultra-thin, yet super strong A-pillar design and low-mounted instrument panel minimize obstructions to the driver\'s view of the road.<br> <br> <strong>Sport Hybrid Power Unit</strong><br> <br> In keeping with the foundational philosophy of the original NSX, the next-generation NSX is designed to provide a new sports car experience that maximizes the capabilities of the driver, delivering exceptionally intuitive and confidence-inspiring response \"at the will of the driver.\"<br> <br> Acura engineers leveraged the company\'s expertise both with high-performance engine and hybrid electric-drive technologies, as well as its two decades of experience with industry-leading dynamic torque-vectoring technologies, including Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD), to create the most sophisticated, technologically advanced and intelligent powertrain in the supercar universe.<br> <br> At the heart of the NSX\'s performance capabilities is an all-new mid-mounted, 75-degree, DOHC V6 engine with twin turbochargers mated to an Acura-developed 9-speed DCT. The V6 engine employs a race-inspired compact valve train and dry sump lubrication system to help lower the center of gravity. The all-new 9-speed DCT delivers synapse-quick gear changes and rev-matching downshifts. The rear direct-drive electric motor, housed between the engine and transmission, supports acceleration, braking and transmission shifting performance. The NSX\'s front wheels are driven by twin independent high-output electric motors which deliver instantaneous torque response and dynamic left-to-right torque distribution.<br> <br> The NSX uses its front electric motors for dynamic torque vectoring in addition to enhancing acceleration and braking performance. The result is an instantaneous \"zero delay\" launch performance and handling response that seems to anticipate the driver\'s desire. The NSX has undergone extensive testing at some of the world\'s most challenging race circuits, including the famed Nurburgring.<br> <br> <strong>Advanced Multi-Material Body</strong><br> <br> Also in keeping with the legacy of NSX—the world\'s first all-aluminum supercar—the new NSX features an innovative new multi-material body design with world\'s-first material applications and construction processes.<br> <br> The NSX body utilizes a space frame design—an internal frame constructed of aluminum, ultra-high strength steel and other advanced materials. Anchored by a carbon fiber floor, torsional and bending forces are taken up entirely by this ultra-rigid structure which also utilizes advanced joining technologies.<br> <br> The NSX features world\'s-first casting technology that combines the design and manufacturing flexibility of a casting process with the strength and elongation properties of a forged material, enabling significant weight reduction. The body panels are composed of a combination of aluminum and sheet molding composite (SMC).<br> <br> <strong>Advanced Sport Package</strong><br> <br> The NSX features an \"Advanced Sports Package\" with placement of key powertrain components -the mid-mounted engine, twin front motors and Sport Hybrid battery pack and power control unit - optimized to concentrate vehicle mass low and toward the center of the vehicle, to further enhance dynamic response. The combination of this packaging concept and the lightweight body give the NSX the lowest center of gravity in its class.<br> <br> The NSX utilizes a fully independent, all-aluminum front and rear suspension and puts its considerable power down through ContiSportContact™ high-performance tires—245/35Z R19 front and 295/30Z R20 rear—mounted on 19x8.5 inch front and 20x11 inch rear aluminum alloy wheels. Powerful, natural and confident braking performance is provided by 6-piston front and 4-piston rear monoblock calipers squeezing ultra-high performance carbon-ceramic brake discs.<br> <br> Handling is greatly enhanced by Sport Hybrid Super-Handling All Wheel Drive (Sport Hybrid SH-AWD), enabling lightning-quick response to all driver inputs—steering, braking and throttle—along with the stability, control and launch performance of all-wheel drive. Agile Handling Assist (AHA) uses the subtle application of brake torque to further enhance yaw response and dynamic stability.<br> <br> The NSX\'s dial-operated Integrated Dynamic System features Quiet, Sport, Sport+ and Track modes. The system adjusts engine, motor, transmission and chassis response, as well as the engine sound level, based on the needs of the driver and driving environment. Quiet mode enables electric-only driving at lower speeds for short durations. Dynamic vehicle responses become increasingly sharp as the driver moves from Sport to Sport+ mode and, finally, to Track mode, where the NSX reveals the full spectrum of its performance capabilities.<br> <br> The NSX also features a \"launch\" function to achieve the ultimate in \"zero delay\" launch performance, aided by both the engine and three electric motors.<br> <br> <strong>New Production Facility</strong><br> <br> The NSX will be manufactured exclusively at the Performance Manufacturing Center (PMC) in Marysville, Ohio, where approximately 100 highly-skilled associates will conduct full body construction, paint, and final assembly using domestic and globally-sourced parts.<br> <br> The PMC and its processes have been developed to perfectly blend associate craftsmanship and technology in a new approach to manufacturing. By in-housing the body construction, Acura maintains complete control over total body quality, including critical strength, suspension accuracy, and fit and finish—from initial construction all the way to final assembly.<br> <br> Associates will utilize innovative techniques to deliver next-generation craftsmanship and world-class quality in the realm of specialized, supercar vehicle production.<br> <br> <strong>##########################################<br> <br> The Acura NSX was created to revolutionize supercar performance, delivering a more vivid, immediate and intuitive dynamic experience with instant acceleration, ultra-powerful yet easily controlled brakes, and exceptional handling—making the most of the driver\'s capabilities in every type of driving environment and rewarding the most skillful drivers with its extraordinary at-the-limit dynamic capabilities.</strong><br> <br> <strong>Ultimate Structural Rigidity</strong><br> <br> Like the original Acura NSX—the world\'s first all-aluminum supercar—the all-new NSX has a cutting-edge structure: its multi-material body and space frame utilize new materials and construction methods to create a structure with unprecedented dynamic rigidity.<br> <br> <strong>Low and Centered Mass</strong><br> <br> The new Acura NSX \"advanced sports package\" is a design philosophy that seeks to optimize the design and packaging of all major vehicle systems—the body, chassis, interior, Sport Hybrid power unit (engine, Direct Drive Motor and 9DCT) and key hybrid components including the Intelligent Power Unit (containing the lithium-ion battery pack), PDU and the TMU—to lower and center the mass of the vehicle for optimal handling and dynamic response. The new NSX has the lowest center of gravity (CG) among its core competitors.<br> <br> The low CG and centered mass pay dividends in handling and response. Biasing the mass toward the center of the NSX reduces the polar moment, making the car respond (yaw rate) faster to steering inputs and reducing its rotational kinetic energy. In other words, it\'s easier to initiate a turn, and easier to stop the rotation. The low CG also reduces the dynamic load transfer, thus stabilizing the vertical load on the tires.<br> <br> The payoffs are quick and precise response to driver inputs, minimal unwanted body movement, and stable tire grip—thus raising the performance levels.<br> <br> <strong>A Tight Grip on the Road</strong><br> <br> The Acura NSX\'s front double wishbone and rear multi-link suspension systems were designed to support the extreme dynamic needs of this unique supercar, and work in perfect harmony with SH-AWD and all other systems.<br> <br> An advanced double-joint front suspension design eliminates torque steer and steering kickback. The rear multi-link suspension provides high lateral rigidity to react faithfully to driver inputs and maintain stability.<br> <br> Third-generation magnetorheological (MR) dampers continuously adjust damping forces in fractions of a second, instantaneously adapting to the driving situation, driver inputs and road conditions.<br> <br> The system maintains the precise design geometry to extract the maximum grip and control from the tires. Agile at low speeds, yet supremely stable and predictable at high speeds, the NSX faithfully translates the driver\'s inputs and always changing road surfaces for ultimate handling performance.<br> <br> Forged light alloy wheels with high lateral stiffness wrapped in 245/35ZR19 front and 305/30ZR20 rear tires provide the NSX\'s interface with the road. Standard high performance summer tires (Continental Conti-Sport Contact) provide excellent dry and wet weather handling and traction. The combination was tuned extensively in a joint effort with Continental to work in unison with the NSX chassis and SH-AWD systems to offer superior traction and grip.<br> <br> Track-focused ultra-high performance summer tires, with elevated grip levels and even higher response characteristics are available as a dealer installed options.<br> <br> <strong>Intuitive Steering</strong><br> <br> The Acura NSX employs a sophisticated dual-pinion (with rack-mounted assist motor) electric power steering (EPS) system with a variable gear ratio. When on center, the ratio is tuned for optimal high speed control and stability. Off center, the gear ratio becomes progressively quicker for improved turn-in and maneuverability at low and mid speeds. The overall quick ratio effectively eliminates the need for driver\'s hand-over-hand steering inputs.<br> <br> High mounting and component stiffness minimize lost motion to help realize high steering accuracy and faithful road feedback. Steering assist levels are modified with the Integrated Dynamics System in concert with the MR dampers to provide appropriate effort and road feel for the desired level of performance.<br> <br> <strong>Aerodynamic Balance &amp; High Speed Stability</strong><br> <br> NSX\'s body shape was effectively designed to minimize aerodynamic drag while creating specifically balanced front-to-rear downforce through a total airflow management approach that focuses on utilizing airflow through each vent, while extracting maximum energy from the airflow field to cool the brakes and power unit.<br> <br> Extensive research and development revealed that placing approximately three times as much downforce at the rear of the vehicle relative to the front of the car provides the optimal downforce balance for high-performance driving as well as everyday functionality.<br> <br> <strong>Sport Hybrid Super Handling All-Wheel Drive</strong><br> <br> Sport Hybrid SH-AWD is a further evolution of Acura\'s highly regarded Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system in vehicles like the Acura TLX sports sedan and MDX sport-utility vehicle. This pinnacle new system electrifies the torque vectoring ability and provides this capacity to all drivers in all driving conditions.<br> <br> The NSX\'s revolutionary Sport Hybrid SH-AWD uses torque vectoring-enhanced vehicle dynamics—and specifically direct yaw control—to ultimate advantage by utilizing the instantaneous and \"always-on\" capacities of its electric motors to directly create a yaw moment at any speed, under power, and in off-throttle driving maneuvers—with greater immediacy and precision.<br> <br> Supported by the advanced yaw-control capabilities of Sport Hybrid SH-AWD, the NSX driver is able to execute super-precise line tracing when aiming for the apex out on the track or on a favorite winding road. What\'s more, the driver can do so with superb vehicle stability as well as a low workload, thus expanding the capabilities of all drivers, ranging from novice clubman to professional racer in virtually any driving scenario.<br> <br> When accelerating the system provides instantaneous torque response via its three electric motors—the Direct Drive Motor and front Twin Motor Unit.<br> <br> While braking, the Acura NSX employs both its muscular mechanical braking system and its regenerative braking capabilities to deliver powerful, precise and virtually fade-free brake performance with very natural and progressive pedal feel while also recapturing kinetic energy to charge the system\'s lithium-ion hybrid battery.<br> <br> When cornering, the NSX\'s Twin Motor Unit and Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) work cooperatively to enhance cornering precision (line traceability). If desired, VSA can be disabled by simply selecting the Track mode setting of the Integrated Dynamics System, and then holding the VSA \"Off\" button, located on a panel to the left of the steering wheel, for at least six seconds.<br> <br> By taking advantage of the immediate high-torque response of the system\'s three electric motors to heighten control, the Acura NSX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD system elevates any driver\'s confidence and performance driving capabilities while extracting more performance from the car than is possible with conventional methods.<br> <br> <strong>Next-Gen Supercar Power</strong><br> <br> At the heart of any supercar lies a powerful and responsive powertrain. The 2017 NSX raises the game by making its tremendous power instantly accessible and finely controllable.<br> <br> Primary power is supplied by the twin-turbo 3.5-liter V6 engine, with peak engine output of 500 hp and 406 lb.-ft. of torque at the driver\'s disposal. Broad power and torque bands mean that this massive motive force is available when the driver really wants it. Dual electric waste gates help manage boost regulation for smooth throttle transitions.<br> <br> The new Acura NSX\'s 9-speed dual clutch transmission also plays a crucial role. Lightning-fast up and downshifts delivered seamlessly make the NSX a joy to drive—the faster the better. The wide total ratio range coupled with closely spaced individual ratios supports maximum extraction of the twin-turbo V6 power. And the transmission programming selects the right gear at the right time, or lets drivers select as they wish.<br> <br> But the real secret to the NSX\'s virtually zero-delay acceleration lies in the seamless integration of the instant and substantial torque from the front TMU and Direct Drive Motor. This right now electric power pushes the NSX\'s total output to 573 hp and allows fine adjustment of power for maximum performance—on the street or track.<br> <br> Importantly, the NSX\'s control systems manage the collective system power and torque smoothly while allowing scintillating response and acceleration. Responses can also be progressively quickened via Integrated Dynamics System settings.<br> <br> <strong>Launch Mode Control</strong><br> <br> For ultimate, high-G acceleration from the standstill, the Acura NSX driver can invoke Launch Mode Control. With the 9-speed DCT set in either Drive (\"D\") or Manual (\"M\") and the Integrated Dynamics System set to \"Track\" mode, the driver depresses the brake pedal with the left foot while simultaneously pushing the accelerator pedal all the way to the floor with the right foot. When the brake pedal is released, the NSX will perform a perfectly executed launch that utilizes peak power from the TMU, twin-turbocharged V-6 engine and Direct Drive Motor.<br> <br> <strong>Super Sports Brakes</strong><br> <br> Seamlessly integrating both mechanical (friction) brakes with electro-servo control and a regenerative brake system, the NSX provides exceptionally precise, linear and virtually fade-free braking performance in almost any driving condition. To support the driver in high-speed driving scenarios as well as at low-speeds, the powerful brake system has been painstakingly tuned for easy, predictable modulation in any condition.<br> <br> The Brembo mono block brake calipers have been designed with high rigidity to provide even pressure distribution and superior pedal feel. Ultra-high performance and lightweight carbon ceramic brake rotors are available as a factory-installed option. Both the carbon ceramic and the standard iron rotors use a two-piece floating design to maintain consistent stopping power under severe braking.<br> <br> <strong>Dialing Up Dynamic Pleasure: The Integrated Dynamics System</strong><br> <br> The NSX Integrated Dynamics System provides the driver with four selectable dynamic modes—Quiet, Sport, Sport+ and Track. The system integrates all of the vehicle\'s dynamic chassis and powertrain systems—steering, brakes, throttle, vehicle stability assist, magnetorheological dampers, engine, transmission, and Sport Hybrid SH-AWD control systems. From the available all-electric operation of Quiet mode to the closed circuit, maximum performance capacities of Track mode, the Integrated Dynamics System progressively dials up the dynamic characteristics of the vehicle based on the needs of the driver and the driving environment.<br> <br> In addition to dynamic system variations, the Integrated Dynamics System varies cabin sounds via Active Exhaust Valve and Intake Sound Control to fine-tune sound quality and volume to match the dynamic character of the vehicle in Quiet, Sport, Sport+ and Track modes. Notably, there is a full 25 dB sound level difference between Quiet and Track modes—a tremendous variance in audible sensation.<br> <br> The NSX Integrated Dynamics System also has the world\'s first custom setting menu that allows the driver to configure the vehicle\'s mode for startup. For example, drivers can program the car to always start in Quiet, or Sport mode, along with the ability to schedule the NSX to operate exclusively in Quiet mode during a specified time period, such as the early morning to avoid waking the neighborhood.<br> <br> <strong>Integrated Dynamics System mode characteristics:</strong><br> <br> Quiet Mode - Quiet mode prioritizes electric-only driving at lower speeds, maximizing energy efficiency and minimizing both cabin and exterior noise. The vehicle uses the TMU for initial launch from a standstill. When power demand requires the engine, it starts more quietly than in other modes and maximum engine speed is limited to 4,000 rpm, while the Active Exhaust and Intake Sound Control valves are closed for a more hushed operation. The transmission shift map also prioritizes lower engine speeds. The driver interface (tachometer and center console information display screen) features a cool and quiet blue color.<br> Sport Mode - Sport mode takes advantage of the Sport Hybrid system to offer the driver a direct responsive vehicle or a more relaxed vehicle according to their driving inputs. Compared to Quiet Mode, it eliminates the 4,000 rpm limit on the engine and quickens throttle response. A more aggressive transmission shift map holds gears longer and allows higher rpm shift points. The Intake Sound Control system and the Active Exhaust Valve are activated, allowing additional intake and exhaust sound to permeate the cabin for a more emotional driving experience. Like Quiet mode, Sport mode provides idle stop function. The Sport mode is the default setting in normal vehicle operation.<br> Sport+ Mode - Sport+ further prioritizes drivetrain response and dynamic performance with faster up- and down-shifts of the 9 DCT and still more aggressive throttle mapping. Maximum use of the electric motor torque provides more explosive acceleration. Increased agility is achieved by harmonizing a more aggressive Direct Yaw Control setting that works in concert with the magnetorheological dampers, Agile Handling Assist, and the Electric Power Steering system—perfect for a spirited drive on a winding road. It also transmits a higher degree of steering feedback, while intake and exhaust note sounds are further increased for an even more exhilarating driving experience. The TFT Meter sports an aggressive yellow \"con-trail\" along the tachometer needle supporting easy recognition of engine RPM. Red highlights for the center console information display also reinforce that the driver is in now in Sport+ mode.<br> Track Mode<br> Optimized for circuit driving, Track mode invokes the most aggressive settings and parameters to assist the driver in capturing the fastest and most consistent lap times possible, along with maximum acceleration from a standstill when utilizing Launch Mode Control. The braking system offers enhanced performance-oriented pedal feel. Up/down gearshift execution of the DCT and performance of the Super Hybrid SH-AWD and active driver aids (VSA, AHA) are programmed to support circuit limit driving, and an even greater amount of engine intake sound permeates the cabin for a heightened driving experience offering enhanced driver feedback even when wearing a helmet.<br> Track mode also prioritizes the lithium-ion battery state-of-charge to maintain a consistent level of torque delivery and direct yaw moment from the three electric motors.<br> <br> Of note, the VSA operation is progressively \"loosened\" from the Integrated Dynamics System Quiet mode up to Track mode, enabling an increasingly higher degree of freedom for the driver in exploring the dynamic capabilities of the Acura NSX. In \"Track\" mode, the VSA system can also be completely disabled by the driver.<br> <br> <strong>Anatomy of a Turn</strong><br> <br> To better understand the dynamic functioning of the Sport Hybrid SH-AWD powertrain and all its related systems—including the V-6 engine, Rear Direct Drive Motor, mechanical and regenerative braking systems, front-mounted Twin Motor Unit and IPU (hybrid battery).<br> <br> <strong>Design Concept</strong><br> <br> The exterior design of the all-new 2017 Acura NSX reflects the integration of exotic supercar aesthetics and exceptional supercar performance. The \"Interwoven Dynamic\" overarching design theme for the exterior architecture epitomizes the concept of \"form following function,\" as every character line, body panel shape or crease, air flow inlet/outlet, and even the vehicle\'s overall proportions have been designed to create a New Sports eXperience. Accordingly, each aspect of the NSX\'s exterior architecture has been optimized to support the dynamic capabilities of the NSX while advancing Acura design into the future.<br> <br> <strong>Exterior Styling</strong><br> <br> Every square inch of the Acura NSX\'s exterior body panel surfaces, fluid shapes, air inlets/exhaust outlets and even the positioning/shaping/thickness of the floating C-pillars serves a distinct purpose—one that has been carefully calculated through thousands of hours of complex computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in combination with extensive wind tunnel testing in the company\'s advanced facilities in the United States and in Japan.<br> <br> \"The idea that form follows function is fundamental to Acura design, and this philosophy is interwoven in the core of NSX, which is why our exterior concept is called \"Interwoven Dynamic,\" said Michelle Christensen, exterior design project leader in the Los Angeles based Acura Design Studio. \"The NSX is a visual expression of beautiful design and performance working together, influencing every decision we made—every surface, every millimeter, every design element of the new NSX is focused on enhancing performance.\"<br> <br> From the acutely angled slope of the chiseled aluminum hood to the rakishly shaped Acura Jewel Eye™ LED headlights and tapered front grille, the front is supercar sleek. The distinctive headlights are bisected by massive mesh-covered air inlets from below and the front fenders are highlighted by a sharply creased character line running all the way from the grille towards thinly sculpted A-pillars.<br> <br> Remarkably compact overhangs, fore and aft, foretell the design and engineering team\'s exemplary packaging of mechanical and electrical components, while the vehicle\'s overall sleek yet muscular stance conveys a sense of purpose and power. The hood line, roofline, floating C-pillars and rear quarter appear as one distinctive and unified curve. The massive yet lightweight high- performance wheel and tire package fit within the arching wheel wells with minimal gap and perfect proportion.<br> <br> The rear of the vehicle is equally striking, highlighted by the signature floating C-Pillars, which cascade gently from the roofline to just forward of the integrated spoiler at the trailing edge of the rear deck lid, flanking an expansive glass panel that reveals the twin-turbocharged V-6 engine.<br> <br> Further accentuating the exterior architecture of the new Acura NSX are a choice of eight paint schemes, each color in the rich palette carefully selected and engineered to accentuate the exterior\'s bold design while ushering in a new level of paint quality within the supercar segment.<br> <br> <strong>Floating C-Pillars</strong><br> <br> The floating C-pillars integrated into the exterior architecture of the all-new NSX are as purposeful as they are distinctive, supporting efficient body-side airflow. The C-pillars extend outward from the sloping rear roofline so that, as air flows down the sides of the vehicle, it is efficiently rerouted into the side-mounted engine air intakes. The floating C-pillars also aid engine cooling by creating a negative pressure zone around the rear heat exhaust vents, along the outside edges of the rear windscreen, improving the efficiency of hot air exhaustion. The portion of air that flows down the side of the vehicle toward the outside section of the buttress is conditioned to reduce turbulence as it passes with minimal disruption over the rear fender and spoiler.<br> <br> <strong>Door Handles &amp; Trunk Access</strong><br> <br> The flush-fitting exterior door handles are both aesthetically pleasing and functional, providing a welcoming \"handshake\" with the driver/passenger as they extend outward from the door upon approach while at the same time supporting clean airflow along the body side.<br> <br> Smart Entry with keyless access is enabled by both proximity sensors, tied to the remote key fob, and capacitive touch sensors in the exterior door handles. A proximity sensor actuates the door handles upon approach, extending them outward for easy operation. Grasping either door handle activates a capacitive touch sensor, which initiates door unlocking. Once the driver/passenger releases the handle, it returns to the flush position. The doors can also be unlocked using the remote key fob—a single push of the unlock button extends the driver\'s door handle and simultaneously unlocks the driver\'s door, while a double push of the button extends both door handles and unlocks both doors.<br> <br> Upon exiting the vehicle, the driver/passenger can lock the vehicle by simply touching a button positioned just forward of the handle or by depressing the lock button on the remote key fob.<br> <br> The exterior door handle mechanism is both a mechanical and electrically operated system. As is the case with an electronically operated system on a vehicle such as an EV, the driver/passenger can sometimes be locked out of the vehicle due to an onboard power failure; this is impossible with the NSX thanks to a redundant mechanical system that allows the driver/passenger to manually operate the door handle without electrical assistance. Automatic door handle extension can be disabled by a switch in the glove box for shipping or long-term storage.<br> <br> The trunk is accessed by means of the remote key fob, by a button located on the driver\'s interior door panel, or by a button discretely located under the trailing edge of the trunk lid. In the event of a loss of power, both the driver\'s door and the trunk also feature a traditional key cylinder for manual locking/unlocking of the doors and trunk.<br> <br> <strong>Supercar Wiper/Washer system</strong><br> <br> The wiper/washer system, engineered specifically for the new NSX, has been designed to operate effectively even at maximum vehicle speeds. Tested in the wind tunnel at airflow equivalent of over 180 mph, the spoiler-shaped wiper blades generate downforce on the wiper blade, while the speed-controlled wiper motor maintains a constant wiping speed, ensuring effective wiper performance in all driving conditions. Likewise, the windshield washer system utilizes a three-nozzle system for superior coverage in all conditions and driving environments, including high-speed travel.<br> <br> In a further nod to improving forward visibility and providing an unobstructed view of the road, the windshield wiper arms are placed as low as possible at the base of the windshield/lower cowl section so that they remain completely out of the driver\'s view when not in operation. Placing the wipers below the hood also helps mitigate wind noise.<br> <br> <strong>Door Mirrors</strong><br> <br> Featuring a two-tone paint scheme that accentuates the Acura NSX\'s low-slung look and wide stance, the door mirrors include a thin blade arm to minimize air turbulence as air flows along the side of the vehicle. This reduces local airflow noise, prevents disruption of air flowing to the side intakes, and minimizes aerodynamic drag. And like the ultra-high-strength A-pillars, the thin blade arm design improves visibility when parking and cornering. Each mirror housing includes an LED turn signal.<br> <br> LED Lighting<br> The exterior design of the 2017 NSX features a variety of light-emitting diode (LED) lighting, including Acura Jewel Eye™ LED headlights, LED daytime running lights (DRL), and LED taillights.<br> <br> <strong>Acura Jewel Eye LED Headlights</strong><br> <br> Acura Jewel Eye LED headlights are a standard feature on every NSX. Designed to complement the aggressive low and wide exterior appearance, each headlight assembly contains six individual LEDs, with the four outer LEDs in operation when using the low beam setting, and all six at work when the high beams are activated.<br> <br> Acura Jewel Eye LEDs provide superior down-the-road illumination with outstanding light distribution and light characteristics and a wavelength close to the human eye\'s luminosity curve. With their lower electrical power consumption, the NSX\'s Jewel Eye LED headlights also have a longer operational life compared to traditional halogen or high-intensity discharge (HID) lamps.<br> <br> <strong>LED Daytime Running Lights (DRL)</strong><br> <br> Utilizing the top half of each LED headlamp that makes up the Acura Jewel Eye™ LED headlight assembly are the NSX\'s LED daytime running lights (DRL). Located just beneath the LED headlamps are the LED position lights, composed of a series of small and tightly packed LEDs that run in a thin continuous line along the bottom of the headlight assembly. LED lighting is also used for the turn signals at both the front and rear of the vehicle.<br> <br> <strong>LED Taillights</strong><br> <br> Similar in character to the Acura Jewel Eye LED headlights at the front of the vehicle, the LED taillights have a compact and narrow appearance with a uniquely freeform shape. The LED taillight array starts off wider, toward the center portion of the rear of the vehicle, then gently tapers as it wraps around towards the outside corners/rear fender arches.<br> <br> <strong>Exterior Body Construction</strong><br> <br> The NSX\'s multi-material body design concept extends throughout the entire body construction. By employing sheet molding composite (SMC), aluminum stampings and high temperature-resistant plastic in key locations of the body, the NSX design team takes advantage of each material\'s unique characteristics to create exterior body panels of the highest finish quality while also minimizing vehicle mass, optimizing weight distribution and center of gravity, and helping to ensure outstanding longevity and durability.<br> <br> <strong>Composite Panels</strong><br> <br> Used extensively in the construction of high-end exotic cars in key exterior componentry, SMC is a high-grade specialty glass-fiber reinforced polyester, its shape formed while heated under pressure within a compression molding. By utilizing special resins as well as high-strength fiber composite matting, Acura NSX exterior design engineers have developed SMC material for specific applications on the vehicle\'s exterior.<br> <br> Specially engineered SMC material is used in the fender sections at all four corners. Designed to possess high structural rigidity, this unique SMC paneling makes an important contribution to optimizing the NSX\'s overall center of mass by minimizing weight at all four corners. The rear trunk skin is also made of lightweight SMC, with structural support provided by a stamped aluminum inner frame structure.<br> <br> A special, high temperature-resistant plastic is used in the small body panel sections just below the floating C-pillars (forward of the rear fenders) due to the body panels\' close proximity to the turbo intercoolers.<br> <br> A rigid, structural SMC material has been developed for the NSX\'s trunk internal structure. This highly rigid construction allows the trunk structure to serve as a mounting point for the rear fenders and rear bumper for a sturdy and precise fit. An added benefit of the trunk compartment design is that it allows for easy removal when the vehicle is brought into an Acura dealer for service; after removing the rear fascia, the entire trunk structure can be removed for easy access to the engine room. This design also simplifies replacement of the rear section should the NSX be involved in a rear-end collision.<br> <br> <strong>Aluminum Panels</strong><br> <br> The Acura NSX door skins are made of sheet hydroformed aluminum. Sheet hydroforming is the ideal means to shape the one-piece aluminum panels that make up each door, as the process supports the construction of complex shapes that cannot be formed by conventional stamping techniques. Moreover, the aluminum door skins can be relatively thin and light as they are naturally supported by the inner door structure.<br> <br> The hood, roof panel and the engine compartment/trunk frame are composed of high-grade stamped aluminum. A carbon fiber roof panel is optional. Like the other composite materials utilized in the exterior, the use of aluminum in these areas offers light weight with excellent structural rigidity and surface quality.<br> <br> <strong>Body Panel Fitment</strong><br> <br> As the near final step in the vehicle assembly process at the Performance Manufacturing Center, the exterior body panels are attached to the vehicle\'s space frame, starting with the roof, then the doors, etc., working from the top down. This process, along with the high degree of dimensional accuracy for the underlying space frame, allows for fine adjustment of panels to achieve consistent and symmetrical panel gaps.<br> <br> <strong>Aerodynamics: A \"Total Airflow Management\" Approach</strong><br> <br> To support the NSX\'s ambitious performance targets, innovative packaging design and exotic styling, the development team completely reimagined the exterior engineering for this modern supercar so that maximum energy is extracted from the flow of air around and through the NSX with the highest efficiency. This \"total airflow management\" strategy supports complete power unit cooling and air intake, brake system cooling, and aerodynamic performance—drag and downforce—at a very high level.<br> <br> Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used extensively during development to maximize the performance of the power unit cooling systems: First, for the proof-of-concept in establishing heat management strategy at the earliest development stage; and second, for continuous thermal performance improvement as the vehicle matured through development.<br> <br> Along with the use of advanced CFD, wind tunnel and real-world testing, the development team employed computerized lap-time simulation models of some of the world\'s most legendary proving grounds that could then be run on chassis-dynamometers allowing testing and validation of computer models for thermal management.<br> <br> <strong>Aerodynamic Design Highlights:</strong><br> <br> <ul>     <li>Efficient cooling openings at the front of the vehicle maximize cooling airflow across the key heat exchangers located within the front section (front engine radiators, Twin Motor Unit cooler, condenser, the transmission gear cooler, hybrid Power Distribution Unit).</li>     <li>Optimized front exit flow paths consider total flow, maximum downforce, low coefficient of drag, and downstream flow structure to feed the engine air intakes.</li>     <li>Wheel wake management vents work in conjunction with fender vents to stabilize airflow down the side of the vehicle, allowing the air to smoothly enter the signature side intakes for efficient cooling. The air that enters the side intakes is distributed to three areas: engine intake, engine room cooling, and turbo intercoolers.</li>     <li>Air flowing over the roof and down the rear glass is captured to feed the transmission clutch cooler and introduce engine-room cooling flow.</li>     <li>Airflow across the rear deck lid works in concert with the taillight slots and rear diffuser to generate significant downforce and effectively manage the air wake generated behind the vehicle. It also minimizes the low-pressure wake coming off the rear of the vehicle and therefore minimizes drag.</li>     <li>Optimization of front/rear downforce distribution for improved handling and stability</li>     <li>Rear brake cooling air ducts designed into the hollow sub-frame direct cooling air to the rear brakes using specially tuned air deflectors located on the rear suspension arms.</li> </ul> <br> <strong>Supercar Aero</strong><br> <br> NSX achieves top-class aerodynamic balance and supercar aerodynamic downforce. Aerodynamic drag is minimized, even while moving large airflows through the vehicle to cool the power unit. Aerodynamic downforce is created by utilizing airflow through each vent, as the NSX \"exhales,\" and through more traditional aerodynamic shape optimization.<br> <br> The Acura NSX has undergone extensive testing at the company\'s state-of-the-art wind tunnel in Raymond, Ohio, using ultra-detailed 40-percent-scale models that replicate the suspension, wheel/tiire, intake and exhaust vents, heat exchangers and major under-hood components. The NSX has also been verified and further refined through testing at full scale in the company\'s wind tunnel in Tochigi, Japan and on real and simulated proving grounds throughout the world.<br> <br> Airflow management vents and precision ducting were tuned to optimize forms with aerodynamicist and designer input during wind tunnel test sessions. A 3-to-1 downforce ratio—placing three times as much downforce at the rear as at the front of the car—provides the optimal balance for high-performance driving as well as everyday functionality.<br> <br> Six vortices flow at the rear of the NSX, including those that support the highest downforce across the rear deck lid. Air flowing from below the car and exiting through carefully optimized rear diffuser fins is a critical vortex that further anchors NSX to the ground. Uniquely, the fins are not parallel to each other, but are narrower toward the front of the car and wider at the rear. This design amplifies negative pressure, enhancing diffuser efficiency which further maximizes downforce.<br> <br> Of note, the NSX aerothermal team worked to evaluate thermal loading in racetrack conditions using a chassis dynamometer. In addition to simulating key performance parameters, such as engine speed and braking, the test included varying wind speeds based on real-world track data. Simulations included Sebring International Raceway and Virginia International Raceway, the latter serving as one of the primary development tracks for the new NSX.<br> <br> <strong>NSX Exterior Finish/Paint</strong><br> <br> The NSX paint team at Acura\'s innovative new Performance Manufacturing Center targeted the highest levels of paint quality with reduced environmental impact, consistent with their target of next-generation quality and craftsmanship.<br> <br> <strong>NSX Body Panel Paint Process</strong><br> <br> Because the Acura NSX\'s exterior body panels are not attached to its space frame until the conclusion of the vehicle assembly process, body panels are treated and painted separately from the frame and are finished to an exceptional level of quality and luster by expert technicians at the Acura Performance Manufacturing Center.<br> <br> NSX body panels enter the paint process attached to a specially designed fixture that locates the panels in a position and angle similar to how they are oriented once installed on the vehicle.<br> All body panels are covered with a high-quality primer coat and, depending upon the specific color application, then receive between five and seven coats of paint. Each layer of colored paint applied to the body panels is allowed to fully cure prior to the next application.<br> A high-quality/long-lasting clear coat is then applied.<br> To help minimize the potential for \"orange peel,\" which occurs when the clear coat on vertical body panels is pulled down by gravity during the curing process, the body paint fixture has hinges that allow the vertically oriented body panels—doors and fenders—to be rotated to a near-fully horizontal position during the curing process.<br> Once cured, the panels undergo careful inspection in a newly designed inspection booth utilizing high-intensity LED lighting to help associates identify and address even the smallest irregularities.<br> Body panels are then hand finished after the first layer of clear coat, and again after the second clear coat.<br> <br> <strong>Interior</strong><br> <br> A complementary and essential component of the all-new Acura NSX\'s New Sports eXperience is its driver-centered interior design, where every element—materials, shapes, technology and layout—are optimized to enhance the driving experience. Exceptional ergonomics, a hallmark of the original NSX, have been further advanced. Moreover, as a pinnacle representation of Acura Precision Crafted Performance, the NSX is designed to provide outstanding comfort, quality and advanced, intuitive technologies, all presented in clean and modern aesthetic.<br> <br> \"The interior of the all-new Acura NSX is highlighted by what we call \'Interwoven Dynamic\' design,\" said Michael Cao, interior project leader. \"It combines the best attributes of intuitive, easy-to-use functionality and superior ergonomics with a clean and modern design aesthetic worthy of a next-generation supercar. It\'s the ultimate testimony to the beautiful simplicity of form following function.\"<br> <br> Artfully sculpted and ergonomic seats are enhanced with supportive yet comfortable bolstering, firmly yet comfortably supporting the driver and passenger and clarifying the driving experience. Strategically placed console and door padding further elevate the driver and passenger lateral support. Materials such as leather and Alcantara® were carefully selected for the ideal combination of craftsmanship and dynamic driving support.<br> <br> The driver\'s instrument cluster and center console have been designed to enhance the driving experience with intuitive layout and simple operation, creating a \"simple sports interface\" for the driver.<br> <br> The next-generation Acura NSX interior also supports the idea of a customizable driving experience, employing a trifecta of advanced sound modulation technologies—Active Sound Control, Intake Sound Control and Active Exhaust Valve—that work in concert with the NSX\'s Integrated Dynamics System to deliver a tunable cabin sound experience commensurate with the desires of the driver and the driving environment.<br> <br> <strong>Visibility</strong><br> <br> To maximize forward visibility, the NSX employs a new technology—three-dimensionally-bent and quenched ultra-high tensile strength steel—to create highly rigid yet very thin A-pillars that offer exceptional strength and roof-crush protection while providing the vehicle\'s occupants with a panoramic view of the road ahead.<br> <br> In addition to the tremendous visibility offered by the streamlined A-pillar construction, the heights of the instrument panel and gauge cluster hood are minimized for enhanced forward visibility.<br> <br> <strong>Interior Illumination</strong><br> <br> The driver\'s gauge cluster and Display Audio touchscreen illuminate upon vehicle entry and progressively brighten to full strength with the start of the Power Unit.

At the base of the center console is a handy inset console front pocket. An additional storage pocket located along the top of the center console between the seats is designed to accommodate a smart phone.<br> <br> The center console also includes a roomy rear console storage box that contains a 1.5-amp USB interface port that can sync a smartphone to the Display Audio touchscreen for operation of Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a phone cord management device located underneath the rubber mat that lines the bottom of the rear storage box.<br> <br> Additional storage is offered by the glovebox, which also includes a 1.0-amp USB interface port that can be used for audio devices such as MP3 players.<br> <br> <strong>Rear Cargo Area</strong><br> <br> The rear cargo area of the new NSX is pleasantly spacious and versatile for a mid-engine high-performance supercar. With 4.4 cubic feet of space and 100 lbs. of capacity, the NSX trunk can conveniently accommodate weekend luggage for two, or even a golf bag—all easily accessed through the rear cargo area\'s wide opening. A set of four rear cargo area tie-down anchors are included to help secure items placed in back, and an accessory cargo net for the rear area is also available. The trunk can be opened using the remote key fob, a button located on the driver\'s interior door or by depressing a discretely located button under the trailing edge of the trunk lid.<br> <br> A valet lock-out switch is located in the NSX\'s glovebox. The driver can activate the valet lock-out switch and lock the glovebox to prevent access to the locked rear cargo area.<br> <br> <strong>Sport Hybrid Power Unit</strong><br> <br> The exceptional dynamic capabilities of the new Acura NSX are enabled by its revolutionary Sport Hybrid Super Handling All-Wheel Drive power unit, the first such system of its kind in a supercar, utilizing electric motor torque in combination with engine power to enhance every element of dynamic performance—acceleration, handling and braking.<br> <br> At the heart of this new Sport Hybrid power unit is a bespoke, mid-mounted twin-turbocharged, 75-degree, 3.5-liter DOHC V6 engine with dry sump lubrication, electric Direct Drive Motor, and an all-new 9-speed dual clutch transmission (9DCT). Together, these components comprise the rear power unit. Amplifying the instant responses and dynamic handling performance of the NSX is the front Twin Motor Unit (TMU), with two electric motors independently driving the left and right front wheels.<br> <br> The NSX\'s Sport Hybrid power unit offers exceptional horsepower and torque with a broad powerband for tremendous throttle response and acceleration. Peak total system output is 573 horsepower—500 horsepower from the gasoline engine and 73 horsepower from the front TMU and Direct Drive Motor.<br> <br> By creating a vehicle propulsion system that utilizes both mechanical and hybrid-electric components rather than just a conventional gasoline-powered internal combustion engine, Acura endows the NSX power unit with constant and linear power anywhere in the powerband, at any speed, with virtually zero delay.<br> <br> For example, at initial launch from a standstill, the front-mounted Twin Motor Unit (TMU) and the Direct Drive Motor immediately supplement power production from the twin-turbocharged V6 engine, using the abundant and instantaneous torque production inherent in electric motors. Conversely, once the vehicle has reached a steady state cruising speed, the twin-turbocharged V6 engine becomes the primary motive force for the vehicle, with the three electric motors providing supplementary power and/or yaw control when necessary.<br> <br> While the primary focus in the development of the all-new Acura NSX\'s clean-sheet power unit was all-out performance, efficiency and environmental sustainability are also important characteristics—as with any Acura powertrain. Therefore, the all-new NSX not only boasts a best-in-class EPA combined fuel economy rating of 21 mpg (20 mpg city/22 mpg highway), but it also meets the California Air Resources Board\'s ultra-low emissions vehicle (ULEV) requirements.<br> <br> <strong>Twin-Turbocharged V6 Engine</strong><br> <br> Featuring a wide V-angle of 75 degrees for a low center of gravity, the NSX\'s 3.5-liter twin-turbo V6 engine achieves the ideal balance between power production, overall compactness and low mass. It combines both direct and port fuel injection, along with Dual Variable Valve Timing Control (VTC) to deliver optimal camshaft phasing, allowing for precision combustion control throughout the entire rpm band while achieving high power output.<br> <br> Additional key engine design elements include a sand-cast aluminum engine block, lightweight and compact aluminum cylinder heads, plasma transferred wire arc thermal spray-coated cylinder walls (for high thermal efficiency with low weight and compact size) and a dry sump lubrication system that significantly reduces the engine\'s center of gravity while ensuring consistent engine lubrication under high cornering load conditions.<br> <br> The NSX utilizes swing arm-type valve actuators which allows for a compact head structure and reduces the inertial weight of the valvetrain by 22 percent compared to a rocker arm-type design. The innovative design was derived from Honda racing engines. Intake and exhaust variable cam timing (VTC) is deployed to provide an excellent balance of high power, torque, fuel efficiency, and emissions.<br> <br> <strong>Turbocharging System</strong><br> <br> Developing a bespoke twin-turbo system for the all-new engine was a logical choice, offering a strong balance of high power with considerable torque, high fuel efficiency and low emissions, while also offering inherent packaging advantages. Maximum boost pressure is set at 105 kPa (1.05 bar, or 15.23 psi). High volumetric flow air-to-air intercoolers are adopted, dramatically reducing intake air temperature while simultaneously increasing the density of the air intake charge for maximum power production.<br> <br> Making use of an electronic wastegate for each turbocharger for fast response and precise control, the single-scroll turbocharger design allows for the use of relatively small turbos to minimize weight and improve packaging while still meeting power and performance benchmarks.<br> <br> <strong>Plasma Transferred Wire Arc Thermal Spray Coating</strong><br> <br> Utilizing an aluminum engine block and heads offered three key advantages compared to traditional cast iron block and head configurations: (1) greatly reduced mass; (2) improved thermal conductivity; and (3) improved heat dissipation. Most aluminum engines require the fitment of cast iron cylinder liners to provide sufficient wear resistance. But engineers on the Acura NSX\'s power unit development team addressed this issue by employing a plasma transferred wire arc thermal spray to the cylinder walls—a recently developed technique that offers 52 percent better heat transfer (thermal conductivity) with greatly reduced weight versus cast iron liners.<br> <br> Using a thin-diameter wire as feedstock material (approximately +/-1 mm), the process melts the wire down to an atomized form that can then be sprayed onto the cylinder walls. A supersonic plasma jet formed by a transferred arc between the tip of the wire and a cathode is used to spray the molten material, stacking the tiny particles on top of each other to form a very thin yet extremely wear-resistant coating.<br> <br> Along with the improved engine efficiency via reduction of internal friction, additional benefits from the thermal spray process include a nearly seven pound decrease in overall engine weight compared to iron cylinder liners, improved wear resistance and reduced oil consumption, and increased horsepower/torque production and throttle response.<br> <br> Furthermore, thanks to the addition of plasma transferred wire arc thermal spray, additional water channels are able to be placed between the cylinder bores for improved cooling efficiency via better control of coolant flow.<br> <br> <strong>Racing-Inspired Cylinder Head Design</strong><br> <br> Using engineering and design expertise drawn straight from the company\'s extensive racing experience, the cylinder heads fitted to the twin-turbo V6 are highly compact and include smaller valvetrain components. This resulted in a notable reduction of inertial weight as well as a 22 percent reduction of cylinder head mass compared to conventional designs. The reduction in mass also helps lower the vehicle\'s center of gravity.<br> <br> The cylinder heads utilize a three-piece water jacket for improved cooling efficiency and coolant flow control. Additionally, the race-inspired cylinder head design optimizes the swirling of intake air so that fuel mixes with it in a more ideal manner for improved combustion—thus improving efficiency and emissions performance.<br> <br> <strong>High Specific Power Output</strong><br> <br> With a compression ratio of 10.0:1 the NSX engine has a specific power output of more than 140 horsepower per liter of engine displacement. The engine safely and reliably achieves the high specific output due to a number of advanced technologies including the efficient twin-turbo system, low internal friction, heat transfer properties of the plasma transferred wire arc thermal spray on the cylinder walls, sodium-filled exhaust valves, implementation of both direct and port injection, and the superior combustibility of fuel from the high-swirl ports.<br> <br> <strong>Dual Variable Valve Timing Control (VTC)</strong><br> <br> The NSX engine incorporates proprietary Dual VTC variable valve timing control technology which delivers an excellent balance of high torque and maximum power output with reduced exhaust emissions and superior fuel efficiency.<br> <br> At engine idle, Dual VTC stabilizes combustion for smooth idling by minimizing intake and exhaust valve overlap, therefore decreasing the amount of exhaust gas recirculation. During steady-state cruise or under light acceleration, the system reduces exhaust emissions and engine pumping losses by optimizing valve overlap. Under wide open throttle at low engine speeds, the overlap of the intake and exhaust cam timing is expanded so that the turbochargers can work at maximum efficiency for optimal power delivery and responsiveness. Conversely, when operating the engine at elevated rpms, overlap of the exhaust and intake timing is minimized for improved volumetric efficiency to create maximum power.<br> <br> <strong>Direct &amp; Port Fuel Injection</strong><br> <br> The NSX engine combines both direct and port fuel injection systems to provide outstanding power with exceptional emissions performance.<br> <br> Direct injection is the primary means of fuel delivery within each cylinder, while port injection is used for additional power output in high-performance driving situations. The direct injection system\'s electronic fuel injectors are mounted in the cylinder heads and spray a very fine, highly atomized mist of fuel directly into each cylinder under very high pressure so that the fuel ignites almost instantaneously and completely with ignition spark, maximizing engine performance and fuel efficiency with reduced emissions. Under high performance demands, the port injection system supplements the direct injection system, feeding fuel into the intake ports where it mixes with the incoming air for increased power production.<br> <br> The direct and port injection systems are fed by two specially designed fuel pumps, one feeding the direct injection system at a fuel pressure of 65 psi, the other supplying the port injection system at 51 to 73 psi.<br> <br> The Acura NSX\'s engine includes advanced lean-burn combustion technology that allows for homogenous and weak stratified combustion to occur within the cylinder due to ultra-precise control of the fuel injection. By ensuring that fuel spray angle and direction do not interfere with the intake valves, along with a strong air/fuel swirl from the high tumble port, high power output and low emissions are effectively combined. Along with optimized piston head and intake port shapes, the highly accurate fuel spray and injection pattern play pivotal roles in this advanced combustion concept.<br> <br> <strong>Intake Manifold</strong><br> <br> A two-into-one intake manifold design minimizes torque deviation between each bank of cylinders. Twin throttle bodies allow more air into the system and finer throttle control while simultaneously reducing the pulsation of air.<br> <br> <strong>Exhaust System</strong><br> <br> Compact and lightweight, the stainless steel exhaust system fitted to the NSX includes two catalytic converters per cylinder bank and four outlets for excellent exhaust gas flow and low emissions. Silicon exhaust system mounts resist heat and offer a robust means of securing the exhaust system to the vehicle, helping to reduce vibration while ensuring system integrity and long life.<br> <br> <strong>Intake Sound Control</strong><br> <br> To enhance the interior auditory experience, the NSX includes a new Intake Sound Control system that works cooperatively (via the Integrated Dynamics System) with the Active Exhaust Valve system.<br> <br> Intake Sound Control utilizes a pipe, connected directly to the engine\'s intake manifold, with an electrically operated butterfly valve that can be opened and shut, depending on the Integrated Dynamics System setting, and a diaphragm that translates high pressure air from the manifold to lower pressure sound waves. On the other side of the diaphragm, the single pipe then splits into two pipes that transmit sound to twin outlets in rear uppermost portions of the cabin. Sound transmission and effect are varied in concert with the four driving modes of the Integrated Dynamics System (Quiet, Sport, Sport+ and Track)—with 25 decibels sound pressure level range between Quiet and Track modes—a tremendous variance in audible sensation.<br> <br> <strong>Active Exhaust Valve</strong><br> <br> An Active Exhaust Valve system has been developed for the new NSX that combines quiet and refined driving and pulse-quickening excitement, operating as a complementary component of the Integrated Dynamics System. The system utilizes two distinct exhaust paths controlled by two electrically-operated valves.<br> <br> In Quiet mode, the exhaust valves are closed and the exhaust gases pass through silencers for a more subdued exhaust sound. Power and torque production from the twin turbo V6 engine is ample.<br> In Sport mode, the exhaust valves are closed unless driver demand is high enough and then will open.<br> In Sport+ or Track modes, the Active Exhaust Valve system is open, bypassing the silencers for a full, uninhibited flow of exhaust gases and a full-throated exhaust note.<br> <br> Together with cabin sound modulation technologies—Active Sound Control and Intake Sound Control—the Active Exhaust Valve system serves to create a customizable auditory experience both within and outside of the NSX—from the hushed silence of Quiet mode to the full concerto of Track mode, when the cabin is filled with sounds every driving enthusiast loves to hear—the high-performance \"pop\" from the exhaust when executing an upshift; the quick blip of the throttle upon downshifting; and the occasional distinctive off-throttle burble that is a welcome reminder of the power and torque capability of the twin-turbocharged V6 engine.<br> <br> <strong>Dry Sump Lubrication</strong><br> <br> In another application of race-bred technology, the all-new Acura NSX is the first production Acura vehicle to use a dry sump engine lubrication system. By replacing the engine\'s conventional oil pan with a separate oil reservoir and a dedicated chain-driven oil pump mounted directly to the lower engine block, the system is designed to prevent oil starvation under high lateral G loads.<br> <br> After being fed to the engine for lubrication, oil is collected from the lower engine block by six separate scavenger pump impellers and then fed back into the oil tank by a pair of pump rotors.<br> <br> Importantly, the adoption of a dry sump system allowed designers to mount the engine 2.4 inches (61 mm) lower within the chassis, significantly lowering the center of gravity thanks to the elimination of a traditional oil pan. The more efficiently cooled oil also helps promote maximum engine power output.<br> <br> <strong>\"Starter-less\" Engine Start System</strong><br> <br> As a byproduct of its Sport Hybrid power unit, the NSX utilizes its Direct Drive Motor to start the engine, replacing a conventional 12-volt engine starter motor.<br> <br> Along with a significant weight savings, further mass reduction was realized by eliminating the 12-volt starter ring gear normally required by a conventional engine starting system.<br> <br> <strong>Engine Idle-Stop</strong><br> <br> To help improve fuel efficiency, the NSX comes equipped with idle stop capability. When the system is active and certain operating conditions are met, the NSX engine will automatically shut off when the vehicle comes to a stop. The system is not engaged when Sport+ or Track modes are selected. When stopped, a special cold storage evaporator in the air conditioning system helps maintain a comfortable cabin temperature even in warm weather.<br> <br> Engine restarts are exceptionally smooth and quick, supported by the use of the powerful Direct Drive Motor as an engine starter. Idle Stop operation is also fully integrated into the operation of the Automatic Brake Hold system.<br> <br> <strong>Engine Balancing and Break-In</strong><br> <br> The NSX power unit development team further improved engine performance and refinement through reduction in experienced noise and vibration. The latest in engine balancing technology and a number of new processes are applied to achieve optimal balance. These include the use of next-generation engine diagnostic equipment to more accurately measure engine imbalance, and the application of variable weight bolts applied to the eight mounting holes in the flywheel, and the addition of nine mounting holes in the crankshaft viscous damper which can be used for fine tuning. Achieving a high degree of harmonic equilibrium not only greatly reduces engine vibration, but also decreases wear of the engine\'s internal componentry for superior reliability and longevity.<br> <br> As an important additional quality step prior to fitment within the NSX, the engine undergoes a \"hot fire\" break-in program, wherein the engine is run under load on a specially designed engine dynamometer for an equivalent of 150 miles of service.<br> <br> <strong>9-Speed Dual Clutch Transmission with Direct Drive Motor</strong><br> <br> The Acura NSX\'s bespoke 9-speed dual clutch transmission (9DCT) works in concert with the Rear Direct Drive Motor to make full use of the power unit\'s broad powerband, producing quick and precise gear changes that support the instant acceleration responses. As a key component of the power unit\'s packaging, the 9DCT has been optimized for compact size, low mass and low center of gravity.<br> <br> The 9DCT has a very wide ratio range that allows for optimal gear selection in any driving condition. First gear ratio is configured for maximum vehicle launch acceleration, while the close-ratio gears (2nd through 8th) are matched to make the most of the power unit\'s powerband. Conversely, high gear (9th) has been optimized for fuel efficiency during steady-state highway cruising. When driving in ninth gear on a level surface at 60 mph, the twin-turbo engine is spinning at only 1,700 rpm.<br> <br> In efforts toward compactness, the clutches and the differential are uniquely situated side-by-side in a common housing. Also, the parallel shaft layout reduces overhang from the rear axle while the center of mass is moved forward.<br> <br> <strong>Quick Response Gear Shift System</strong><br> <br> One of the key parameters that sets a supercar apart from competing vehicles is how quickly it can execute gear shifts. To deliver superior shifting performance, the 9DCT features unique components to deliver lightning quick yet smooth gear changes.<br> <br> Highly rigid shift forks composed of a specialized high-strength cast iron play a key role in providing quick shifts. A total of five shift forks are used for the gear actuator system: a one-way clutch is used for 1st gear; four shift forks are used for the 2nd through 9th gears; and a fifth shift fork is employed for Park and Reverse.<br> <br> <strong>Gear Shift Actuator</strong><br> <br> Ultra-quick shift response and engagement with reduced weight (vs. conventional pneumatic or hydraulically operated gear actuators) is made possible by the use of a compact electric motor as a gear shift actuator. Weight is reduced by eliminating the high-pressure hydraulic pump that is typically used in a gear shift actuator system, while providing for excellent reliability and system robustness.<br> <br> <strong>Electric Clutch Actuator</strong><br> <br> Like the aforementioned electric motor-powered gear actuator, the electric clutch actuator eliminates the need for a high-pressure hydraulic pump. Control of the clutch is accomplished via a closed-circuit hydrostatic structure, providing oil pressure on demand with greater efficiency.<br> <br> <strong>Integrated Dynamics System Modes Modify Shift Characteristics</strong><br> <br> Adding to the performance characteristics of the NSX\'s advanced 9-speed DCT is the ability to modify shift speed and feel via the distinctly different transmission settings within the driving modes of the Integrated Dynamics System:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>Quiet - Transmission shift map directs gear shifts at lower engine speeds</li>     <li>Sport - Transmission allows the engine to rev more freely and makes gear changes in a higher RPM range</li>     <li>Sport+ - Accommodates higher engine speed gear changes with quicker, more aggressively executed upshifts and downshifts</li>     <li>Track Mode - Fastest upshifting—40 milliseconds faster than Sport+ settings</li> </ul> <br> <strong>Flywheel Mass Damper</strong><br> <br> To minimize powertrain vibration, the flywheel has been designed to also act as a mass damper to minimize mechanical/harmonic vibration caused by oscillation, while helping to ensure structural integrity and longevity of the transmission case.<br> <br> <strong>Limited-Slip Differential</strong><br> <br> The new NSX\'s remarkably crisp turning capability and tractability is further enhanced by a mechanically-based limited-slip differential (LSD).<br> <br> Designed to deliver excellent poise and stability while making of the most of the power unit\'s ample power production, the torque-sensitive multi-plate clutch is lighter and more compact than a similar unit with a helical gear configuration. Also, the multi-plate design allows for improved wheel coupling for smoother and more efficient operation.<br> <br> The NSX\'s LSD torque bias ratio—an index for slip limit torque that compares torque shifted from a high rotation axle to a low rotation axle—has been optimized to provide two distinct LSD performance settings ideal for when the wheels are being driven or when the vehicle is coasting.<br> <br> Engineered to complement the Twin Motor Unit (TMU) and Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) systems with precision torque vectoring and enhanced traction maintenance, the LSD helps advance vehicle performance in a number of driving situations:<br> <br> Under Braking/Deceleration Approaching a Turn - Increases engine brake torque on the outside tire/wheel for improved vehicle stability<br> Straight-line Driving - Torque is transferred left-to-right as necessary for enhanced vehicle stability when driving in a straight line.<br> Under Acceleration while Turning - Overall vehicle tractability and poise is improved by shifting torque to the outside tire as traction from the inside tire decreases.<br> <br> <strong>Rear Power Unit Mounting</strong><br> <br> By employing strategically-placed rear power unit mounting points—up high at the front of the engine along with a mounting cradle bracket down low at the rear (connected to the transmission)—roll, pitch and yaw motion of the power unit is greatly reduced, providing greater acceleration response and handling ability.<br> <br> <strong>SPORT HYBRID SYSTEM</strong><br> <br> The Sport Hybrid system is a suite of highly advanced components at the center of the hybrid-based systems of the power unit. Each component is engineered to minimize both weight and size in order to reduce overall vehicle mass, and carefully packaged within the NSX to lower and center the mass within the vehicle. Collectively, the Sport Hybrid system includes the Twin Motor Unit (TMU), Direct Drive Motor, Power Drive Unit (PDU), and Intelligent Power Unit (IPU).<br> <br> <strong>Twin Motor Unit (TMU)</strong><br> <br> The new Acura NSX\'s instant and linear acceleration coupled with outstanding dynamic capability is enabled in large part by its front-mounted Twin Motor Unit (TMU). Designed to be as small and lightweight as possible while delivering ample torque and power, as well as precise torque vectoring to the front wheels, the TMU is a unique and highly efficient solution to provide supplemental power to the twin-turbo V6 engine for instantaneous acceleration whenever desired.<br> <br> The TMU provides instant torque as well as AWD capability, allowing direct and immediate acceleration with a heightened sense of G-loading that invigorates the senses. Further, the TMU can dynamically apportion its torque to create a yaw moment, enhancing cornering performance. Finally, the TMU recovers braking energy during deceleration to supply power to the hybrid batteries.<br> <br> Inside its die-cast aluminum housing are two electric motors positioned back-to-back. Each 36 horsepower motor powers a single front wheel and can also apply negative torque to the same wheel. A gear mechanism allows the motors to decouple and still provide on-demand torque vectoring, helping to improve efficiency in certain conditions.<br> <br> To achieve maximum acceleration from a standstill and to meet the NSX engineering and design team\'s target of instant response, the TMU and Direct Drive Motor provides the bulk of the accelerative force during initial acceleration from a standstill. After the first 0.15 seconds/0.1 G off of the line, the high horsepower and torque from the twin-turbocharged V6 engine enters the fray, along with still more power from the Direct Drive Motor. From there, the engine exponentially increases its power contribution as the vehicle continues accelerating.<br> <br> The TMU is also a key motive force for driving in the Quiet mode setting of the Integrated Dynamics System, allowing for hushed vehicle operation by powering the NSX electrically for short distances.<br> <br> <strong>Direct Drive Motor</strong><br> <br> The Direct Drive Motor, mounted between the engine and transmission, is ideally packaged to provide additional torque and power assist to the rear wheels in the most efficient manner.<br> <br> To help eliminate the response delay typically associated with turbocharged engines, the Direct Drive Motor (shown at left) acts directly on the engine\'s crankshaft which, together with the TMU, help the NSX realize immediate, high-output, high-torque acceleration performance. The effectiveness of this design is particularly noticeable in everyday driving when accelerating from a standstill and at low engine speeds. Additionally, the Direct Drive Motor acts as a generator to help charge the hybrid batteries, while also acting as the engine starter.<br> <br> The Direct Drive Motor is liquid cooled to ensure ample cooling and heat dissipation even when the system is being worked hard, such as on a track day.<br> <br> <strong>Intelligent Power Unit (IPU)</strong><br> <br> Neatly packaged in the cabin, just forward of the rear bulkhead, the Intelligent Power Unit (IPU) acts as the primary heart and brains of the E-Drive system, integrating the lithium-ion battery pack, junction board, a high-voltage distribution bus bar, 12-volt DC-DC converter, electric motor ECU, lithium-ion battery ECU and the ECU for the TMU.<br> <br> Thanks to the integration of a next-generation lithium-ion battery pack and a caseless structure for key Intelligent Power Unit (IPU) components, the Acura NSX\'s IPU system is 35 percent smaller and 30 percent lighter than the IPU in the Acura RLX Sport Hybrid sedan.<br> <br> When driving in Sport, Sport+ and Track modes, the vehicle\'s air conditioning system is used for supplemental cooling of the IPU for optimal efficiency and performance. During development, the system was tested extensively in the desert heat of Dubai in order to ensure proper function in extreme ambient temperatures.<br> <br> <strong>Lithium-ion Battery Pack</strong><br> <br> Packaged within the IPU is the lithium-ion battery pack which stores the electrical energy to power the TMU and Direct Drive Motor.<br> <br> The high-output battery pack consists of four modules, each with 18 individual battery cells (72 cells in total) contained within a specially designed caseless structure that utilizes the vehicle body itself for a lightweight yet sturdy housing. Compared to the latest Acura RLX hybrid, the NSX battery pack\'s power density (stored energy per kilogram) has been increased 10 percent while energy density is up 15 percent.<br> <br> Power output and efficiency of operation have been further improved by implementing a cooperative battery cooling system, fed by fresh cool air channeled into the passenger compartment via the vehicle\'s air conditioning. Cool air from within the cabin circulates through ducting to cool both the lithium-ion batteries as well as the DC/DC converter.<br> <br> <strong>Power Drive Unit</strong><br> <br> The Power Drive Unit (PDU) dictates the power management strategy of the Sport Hybrid SH-AWD system, including motor power and battery recharge. The PDU also incorporates three separate converters (converting direct current to alternating current) for use by the power unit\'s three electric motors: the twin motors of the front-mounted TMU and the Direct Drive Motor. This compact \"three-into-one\" PDU design is critical to the system\'s compact packaging and the ability to mount it centrally in the vehicle, in the center tunnel (beneath the center console).<br> <br> <strong>Chassis</strong><br> <br> The next-generation NSX chassis, consistent with the Sport Hybrid SH-AWD powertrain and Multi-Material body, combines fundamental concepts in sports car design with advanced new technologies to elevate and enhance the NSX driving experience.<br> <br> Anchored to the vehicle\'s ultra-rigid aluminum-intensive space frame and industry-first ablation cast frame nodes, the NSX\'s sophisticated all-aluminum front and rear suspension systems—augmented by third-generation active magnetorheological (MR) damper technology, dual-pinion variable gear ratio electric power steering (EPS) system, and electro-mechanical sports brakes—elevate the NSX\'s dynamic capabilities and responses to driver inputs while supporting the breakthrough capabilities of its Sport Hybrid SH-AWD system.<br> <br> Deceleration capability is enhanced with a next-generation electro-servo braking system that combines the effectiveness of a mechanical (friction) braking system that utilizes large ventilated rotors and aluminum brake calipers with the efficiency of a seamlessly integrated regenerative braking system.<br> <br> <strong>Suspension</strong><br> <br> One of the key traits that set the original Acura NSX apart from its contemporaries was its novel use of a finely-tuned aluminum suspension. The NSX team went back to the fundamentals to design the next-generation NSX\'s lightweight all-aluminum, fully independent front and rear suspension system.<br> <br> Utilizing lightweight yet rigid aluminum alloy components at all four corners, the NSX\'s suspension keeps unsprung weight to a minimum while retaining component stiffness for instant and accurate response. Designed to work seamlessly with the advanced electric power steering system, the optimized tuning of the NSX\'s steering and suspension systems allow for both nimble responses at low speeds, coupled with superlative high-speed stability.<br> <br> <strong>Front Suspension</strong><br> <br> The all-aluminum front suspension has been optimized with compact and lightweight components and suspension geometry developed for superior handling performance, crisp and communicative on-center steering feel and excellent stability. Specifics include:<br> <br> All-aluminum, forged double wishbone/cast aluminum knuckle design<br> Double ball joint lower control arm to mitigate torque disturbance from the front Twin-Motor Unit (TMU) torque vectoring<br> No unwanted steering kickback<br> Third-generation active MR dampers<br> <br> <strong>Rear Suspension</strong><br> <br> Featuring lightweight all-aluminum components, the rear suspension employs a sophisticated independent multi-link design. Specifics include:<br> <br> All-aluminum, forged multi-link/cast aluminum knuckle design<br> High lateral rigidity<br> Third-generation active MR dampers<br> <br> <strong>Active Magnetorheological (MR) Dampers</strong><br> <br> Making use of Acura-tuned third-generation magnetorheological (MR) dampers in place of conventional shock absorbers, the Acura NSX\'s highly advanced suspension essentially acts as a continuously adaptive \"active\" system that can adjust damping forces in a fraction of a second, instantaneously adapting to the driving situation, driver inputs and road conditions.<br> <br> The new third-generation MR damper technology offers the widest range of damping force and the fastest response for maximum handling capability and ride quality in all driving conditions. The reservoir within each of the NSX\'s MR dampers is filled with a special magnetorheological (MR) fluid that contains microscopic metallic particulate. Running an electric current to each MR damper creates a magnetic field within the fluid that causes an instantaneous change in the fluid properties and resulting change in damping force.<br> <br> While many active dampers make use of a an internal valve-based technology to vary the damping force, the Acura MR dampers utilize a valve-less design that offers a much broader range of damping force and more rapid response.<br> <br> The lightning-quick response rate and superior damping properties allow the NSX to make optimum use of a high-performance tire design and low-profile sidewall while still providing comfortable ride quality.<br> <br> The MR dampers also function as a component of Integrated Dynamics System via two unique damper tuning settings—one biased toward unsprung mass control, used for Quiet and Sport modes; and a second with optimized performance tuning biased toward sprung mass control, used for Sport+ and Track modes.<br> <br> <strong>Wheels and Tires</strong><br> <br> The Acura NSX chassis design and engineering team has configured a bespoke wheel and tire package that extracts optimal performance from the platform, not only in lateral grip but in every element of driving performance including acceleration and braking.<br> <br> The standard wheel design package for the new NSX includes lightweight Y-spoke forged aluminum alloy wheels wrapped in Continental Conti-Sport Contact 5P tires (245/35ZR19 front; 305/30ZR20 rear) developed jointly with Continental specifically for the NSX. This tire package strikes an excellent balance between high performance and everyday drivability, offering high levels of traction in both wet and dry conditions.<br> <br> The unique \"Y\" wheel design is a result of the NSX engineering team\'s extensive research to find the strongest and most rigid spoke structure with the least amount of material. Forged in high-strength aluminum, the wheel design offers a lower total weight than any wheels of similar size and material composition within the NSX\'s competitive class.<br> <br> An optional factory-installed wheel set utilizes a stylish thin interwoven wheel spoke design featuring a machined/polished, fully polished, or fully painted finish.<br> <br> Both wheel packages feature staggered fitment to optimize chassis performance, the front wheels measuring 19 x 8.5J, with wider 20 x 11J wheels at the back.<br> <br> The Acura NSX comes standard with high performance summer tires; ultimate handling performance tires for track day outings are optionally available.<br> <br> <strong>Electric Power Steering (EPS)</strong><br> <br> The NSX\'s sophisticated electric power-assisted rack-and-pinion-based steering system (EPS) responds instantaneously to steering input and automatically adjusts to deliver the appropriate level of power assist in all driving situations, exhibiting many advantages over an engine-driven hydraulic-based steering system:<br> <br> Reduced weight and improved packaging due to its compactness and fewer components—no hydraulic fluid, pump, fluid storage tank or hydraulic fluid lines/hoses<br> Reduced levels of noise and vibration without the hydraulic system<br> Improved fuel efficiency with no parasitic drag from an engine-driven power steering pump<br> <br> \"It was a huge challenge to create a lively and communicative Electric Power Steering (EPS) for the driver that would be truly worthy of a next-generation Acura NSX,\" said Chris Dundon, chassis design project leader. \"But by optimizing the mechanical components within the system, plus careful tuning of the software, we were able to achieve our goal of delivering highly responsive steering with outstanding driver feel.\"<br> <br> The NSX electric power steering (EPS) system utilizes a variable gear ratio. When on center, the ratio is tuned for optimal high speed control and stability. Off center, the gear ratio becomes progressively quicker for improved turn-in and maneuverability at low and mid speeds while minimizing the need for hand-over-hand motions.<br> <br> The addition of a motor-assisted second pinion to the EPS system more precisely assists with turning force and steering assistance based on a number of factors—engine speed/electric motor torque from the Sport Hybrid power unit, steering angle, vehicle speed, steering force and EPS steering maps/algorithms—leading to improved steering feel and feedback for the driver.<br> <br> Like the MR damper suspension system, the NSX features two distinct EPS steering settings—one for the Quiet/Sport modes and another for Sport+/Track modes of the Integrated Dynamics System—with tuning adjusted to deliver an increased level of acuity and performance for an even greater degree of driver feedback by reducing steering assist based on vehicle speed and steering angle for the more performance-oriented Sport+ and Track driving modes.<br> <br> <strong>Next-Generation Super Sports Brakes</strong><br> <br> The NSX\'s next-generation braking system—combining conventional mechanical (friction) with an advanced electro-servo system and regenerative braking—inspires confidence in every driving situation thanks to the highly communicative brake pedal feel and linear, virtually fade-free brake performance.<br> <br> Of high importance was developing a regenerative braking system that blends seamlessly with the Acura NSX\'s conventional brake system, with exceptional brake pedal feel and predictable stopping performance.<br> <br> <strong>Regenerative Braking</strong><br> <br> By supplementing the high-performance mechanical (friction) braking system with regenerative braking, the NSX captures \"free\" electricity and feeds it back into the lithium-ion battery pack. Unlike many such systems, the NSX blends this capability in a seamless and effective way, resulting in intuitive brake pedal feel with superb feedback.<br> <br> Regenerative braking begins as soon as the driver releases the throttle pedal to maximize lithium-ion battery recharging during normal driving.<br> <br> <strong>Electro-Servo Brake System (ESB)</strong><br> <br> The electro-servo braking system has been designed and developed through rigorous testing to provide the driver with superb feedback and intuitive brake pedal feel in all conditions. This allows drivers to finely modulate braking force in any condition—from low speed city traffic, to flat out track driving.<br> <br> The high degree of brake pedal feel is achieved through precise pressure control by the electro-servo brake (ESB); the operation of the ESB is then finely tuned to deliver consistent and proper brake pedal feel for each of the drive mode settings of the Integrated Dynamic System.<br> <br> Importantly, the brake pedal feel remains consistent and predictable across the four different drive mode settings of the Integrated Dynamic System whether in city or highway conditions, or driving all-out on the race track.<br> <br> <strong>Brake System Components</strong><br> <br> The high-performance Brembo braking system features large six-piston calipers with 14.5-inch, two-piece iron and aluminum ventilated brake rotors up front, and four-piston calipers with 14.0-inch, two-piece iron and aluminum ventilated rotors at the rear. All calipers are of an aluminum mono block design, which provides even pressure distribution across the surface of the brake rotor with outstanding heat dissipation and excellent rigidity. The two-piece iron and aluminum rotors provide consistent brake pad-to-rotor surface contact with high heat capacity and cooling efficiency. Additionally, this two-piece rotor configuration allows for much greater thermal expansion compared to a one-piece design.<br> <br> An ultra-high-performance carbon ceramic brake rotor package (15.0-inch rotors up front/14.0-inch rear), available as a factory option, offers a substantial reduction in weight, saving nearly 52 pounds (23.5 kg) over the standard brake package along with improved fade performance in high stress conditions, such as track sessions. The package includes a choice of three different brake caliper color options: red, black or silver<br> <br> <strong>Optimized Brake Cooling</strong><br> <br> Through extensive research and development, optimal brake cooling has been achieved as an integral part of the NSX\'s advanced aerodynamic design. Even under the high stress scenario of extended track drives, front and rear brake cooling is always robust, providing consistent deceleration capability, brake pedal feel and superb vehicle stability.<br> <br> Typically, effective brake cooling at the rear of a mid-engine vehicle is difficult due to component packaging, and the proximity of the engine and transmission and the heat they generate. Rear brake cooling on the NSX is enhanced by the innovative use of the NSX\'s rear sub-frame where two air duct paths have been designed into the hollow structure. Air passing through the sub-frame is precisely directed to the rear brakes, using specially tuned air deflectors located on the rear suspension arms. Thanks to this clever piece of engineering, rear brake performance is further optimized to support both everyday and at-the-limit driving performance.<br> <br> <strong>Powertrain Mounting System</strong><br> <br> With the newly designed twin-turbocharged V-6 engine, special consideration was given to how the powertrain—engine, Direct Drive Motor, 9-speed dual clutch transmission and differential—is secured to the chassis in order to achieve outstanding dynamic properties while producing the lowest levels of noise and vibration.<br> <br> The solution was to create an engine cradle system that combines hydraulic engine mounts with a rigid aluminum sub-frame plate that simultaneously supports the engine while acting as a vibration and noise inhibitor. Powertrain mounts are ideally located—with an axis that passes through the powertrain\'s center of gravity—to minimize pitch and roll movement of the powertrain mass. Testing and analysis demonstrated that this novel configuration provides notably improved vehicle handling performance while exceeding targeted NVH levels.<br> <br> <strong>Fuel Tank</strong><br> <br> Finding the shape and placement of the fuel tank for best weight distribution and low center of gravity was a difficult design task, especially when taking into consideration protection in the event of a rear-end collision. The solution was a design using twin tanks composed of a specialized resin material. That allowed for tremendous flexibility in the shape of the fuel tanks for optimal packaging and enhanced safety performance. The tanks are centrally located between the engine and the IPU, which is behind the rear bulkhead.<br> <br> <strong>Multi-Material Body</strong><br> <br> To unlock the full potential of the 2017 Acura NSX\'s Sport Hybrid SH-AWD powertrain and fulfill the high targets set for its total dynamic performance, the engineering team took a bold and challenging new direction: a completely clean-sheet, multi-material approach that breaks new ground in the automotive realm—with new materials, new construction methods and new thinking in supercar body design.<br> <br> By starting from scratch, the NSX development team was able to choose the optimal material application and construction methodology for each area of the body, targeting both low mass and ultimate rigidity while also satisfying other critical design objectives such as superior outward visibility, world-class crash safety performance and world-class quality and durability befitting a next-generation Acura supercar.<br> <br> The end result is the NSX multi-material body, with its aluminum intensive space frame, designed to achieve structural rigidity far superior to its top-in-class competitors. This high level of dynamic rigidity provides a crucial foundation for the NSX\'s instantaneous responses. As a result, drivers will feel their inputs directly translated to the car\'s actions with incredible speed and fidelity, while simultaneously allowing the maximum potential of the Sport Hybrid SH-AWD system to be realized by the car and driver—the essence of the New Sports eXperience.<br> <br> \"The challenge for the body design team was to create a body with a high level of rigidity to be able to transmit the full feeling of this powertrain directly to the driver without delay,\" said Shawn Tarr, chief engineer for the NSX body development. \"While the all aluminum unibody of the original NSX was ahead of its time, we would need to look to world-first technology in order to achieve this new level of rigidity.\"<br> <br> The Acura NSX body construction—performed entirely in-house at Acura\'s Performance Manufacturing Center (PMC) using domestic and globally-sourced parts—is undertaken with innovative new techniques and technologies, and with a commitment to quality unmatched in the supercar realm. As one critical example, MIG welding of the aluminum-intensive space frame is performed entirely by high-precision robots, with all welds and body components undergoing a detailed inspection by highly skilled PMC weld technicians.<br> <br> Building quality and accuracy into the space frame eliminates the post-construction machining activity that is common in low-volume vehicle manufacturing, including many competing vehicles. This same commitment to next-generation quality through the ideal blend of machine precision and human craftsmanship can be found in every aspect of NSX\'s body construction, finishing/painting and assembly, and is readily identifiable in the final product.<br> <br> <strong>Multi-Material Space Frame</strong><br> <br> The NSX multi-material body with aluminum-intensive space frame offered the development team the best structural rigidity and lowest platform weight along with superior packaging for the power unit. NVH is also greatly minimized by the NSX\'s tremendous global rigidity benchmarks—two times static and three times dynamic levels of torsional rigidity demonstrated by the next highest competing vehicle evaluated by the NSX development team.<br> <br> Highly rigid and reinforced extruded aluminum beams comprise the majority of the space frame and are utilized for the front and rear frame rails and cross members, front and rear bulkhead frame members, floor cross members and side rails. To further aid noise attenuation, a number of these aluminum extrusions are filled with acoustic spray foam, which is used in 38 different locations.<br> <br> Cast aluminum nodes serve as joining points for the extruded aluminum frame members and as ultra-rigid mounting points for the vehicle\'s front and rear suspension systems, as well as its rear power unit. These nodes are either gravity die cast or, in front and rear crush zones, formed using advanced new ablation casting technology, a world\'s first automotive application.<br> <br> In another world\'s first, the upper portion of the A-pillars and roof rails, which comprise one continuous section, are formed using three dimensionally bent and quenched ultra-high strength steel tubing. This new metal forming process allows enhanced styling and outward visibility while providing for high roof-crush strength.<br> <br> Aluminum stampings are utilized as lightweight closure panels for the rear floor, rear bulkhead and B-pillars. The front floor panels are constructed of carbon fiber for strength and low weight.<br> <br> <strong>Ablation Cast Nodes</strong><br> <br> One of the most difficult design challenges in the development of the all-new Acura NSX was to minimize the front and rear overhangs of the vehicle while managing collision energy absorption in key areas for crash safety performance and maintaining optimal structural rigidity. To solve these complex and competing design imperatives, Acura engineers developed innovative new technology called ablation casting, an all-new material application and a world\'s-first application in the automobile industry. Ablation casting was matured from a fundamental research theme to production vehicle application within the development cycle of the new Acura NSX—a major design, engineering and manufacturing achievement.<br> <br> Ablation casting is utilized in the creation of six joining members, or nodes—two upper and two lower nodes in the front frame, and two nodes in the rear frame. These nodes also serve as ultra-rigid mounting points for both the front and rear suspensions. The front upper nodes are designed to absorb and dissipate energy in a frontal collision. The two ablation cast nodes at the rear of the vehicle are designed for high strength to mitigate forward movement of the power unit in the event of a severe rear collision.<br> <br> Ablation casting involves the rapid cooling of a sand-cast aluminum component via the precise application of water jets, which ablate the sand mold while cooling the part. This process allows for the fine-tuning of both the cast part\'s shape and its material properties while minimizing weight with hollow forms and optimized wall thicknesses. Unlike traditional castings, the high-strength and ductile properties of the ablation cast members allow these sections of the space frame to progressively crush at 155 kN of load; and the rear frame nodes are designed to withstand up to 210 kN of load.<br> <br> The ablation cast nodes are produced in-house at the company\'s Anna, Ohio engine plant, which has extensive experience with precision casting. The Anna Engine Plant is the only automotive production facility in the world utilizing ablation casting technology.<br> <br> <strong>3-Dimensional Bent and Quenched Ultra-High Strength A-Pillar</strong><br> <br> The original NSX was known for its outstanding forward visibility, giving drivers a feeling of being connected to the road while optimizing visibility, and this design attribute was considered essential to preserving a core characteristic of the NSX driving experience. For the next-generation NSX A-pillars, new advancements in forming ultra-high strength steel parts provided the ideal solution, meeting the engineering team\'s goals for safety performance while maximizing forward visibility.<br> <br> The NSX\'s A-pillars have been precisely crafted using an all-new, three-dimensional forming and tempering process that allows for a complex part shape with ultra-high tensile strength. This \"3D bent and quenched\" component is heated and then shaped in three dimensions by an articulating robotic arm, after which the part is quenched using water jets to achieve an ultra-high tensile strength of 1,500 megapascals. This process enables a very thin cross-section with precise shape specification and tolerances, while also meeting the increased structural rigidity standards for roof-crush performance. Utilization of this process reduced the width of the A-Pillar—at just 3.5 inches (89 millimeters) in width—by one inch (25 mm) compared to a conventional construction process; the view is a full 36 percent less obstructed than the next-best supercar evaluated by the Acura team and even better than the original NSX.<br> <br> To prevent galvanic corrosion, the component receives an electro-deposited coating before being joined to the stamped steel structure at the base of the A-pillars.<br> <br> <strong>Carbon Fiber Floor</strong><br> <br> When evaluating material composition and placement throughout the body, the design team determined that carbon fiber would serve as the ideal material for the driver and passenger floor section. In addition to its light weight, the material is strong enough to handle the loads occupants place on the floor during vehicle ingress/egress. Aluminum sheeting would have required additional cross-member frame support beneath it which would have in turn added additional weight.<br> <br> <strong>Space Frame Construction</strong><br> <br> A number of advanced technologies and techniques are used in the construction of the Acura NSX space frame, which is conducted entirely in-house at the company\'s new Performance Manufacturing Center in Marysville, Ohio. The NSX development and manufacturing teams were determined to maintain in-house control of the complete body construction process to ensure the highest levels of quality and performance for Acura customers.<br> <br> Through the implementation of strict manufacturing/build processes and quality controls, the dimensional accuracy of the multi-material body is maintained throughout the construction process, eliminating the need for post-process machining. This is a unique manufacturing system and a great point of pride for Acura, allowing the team to achieve quality and accuracy levels superior to its competitors.<br> <br> <strong>Metal Inert GAS (MIG) Welding</strong><br> <br> Metal Inert Gas (MIG) welding is utilized for the majority of the aluminum space frame construction. The frame contains more than 860 MIG weld points, where more than 112 feet (34 meters) of MIG wire is applied. Most welding is done by fully automated robotic weld arms which offer exceptional precision and control.<br> <br> For the underbody section of the space frame, construction is done in a series of four stations, where highly skilled weld technicians work in tandem with automated robotic weld machines to ensure the highest quality parts. Specialized picture frame-style fixtures, developed in-house, are used to hold the component pieces, allowing for precise control of the weld process and dimensional accuracy of the part. Four of these fixtures are able to rotate 360-degrees to improve the access of robotic weld arms to the part and to allow for full datum referencing (highly accurate measurements between lines on a three-dimensional X, Y and Z axis) of the part.<br> <br> Strategic sequencing of the numerous weld processes mitigates the potential for parts deformation from heat buildup, a common challenge in the welding of aluminum components. The quality of welds and dimensional accuracy of the part are confirmed at each station by technicians through visual inspection.<br> <br> The floor and upper components of the space frame are then joined by large, fully robotic general welders, which also utilize rotating trunion-type fixtures with 360-degree movement. Twin robotic weld arms are able to conduct welding processes simultaneously to aid in both manufacturing efficiency and in the uniform distribution of heat, mitigating the potential for part deformation.<br> <br> Additional body joining technologies including self-piercing rivets, flow-drill screws, and roller hemming, each chosen for its specific and unique qualities within a given element of the overall space frame construction.<br> <br> Self-piercing rivets (SPR) allow for the joining of two or more layers of material without having to pre-drill or punch a hole and are ideal for joining sheet materials while providing an exceptionally watertight joint. The NSX space frame contains more than 345 self-piercing rivets.<br> Flow-drill screws (FDS) are used in the place of a nut-and-bolt application in numerous areas of the space frame, reducing both weight and parts complexity. FDS are also particularly well suited to areas of the body where one side of the part is inaccessible by conventional tools, such as in an extruded component. More than 245 flow-drill screws are applied to the NSX space frame.<br> Roller Hemming joins two pieces of sheet metal by creating a sharp-angle bend, allowing the metal to be folded back over itself, creating a strong and tight joint with a clean and finished edge. There is nearly 60 feet (18 meters) of roller hemming edge on the NSX space frame.<br> <br> <strong>Space Frame Advanced Conversion Coating</strong><br> <br> Prior to final assembly—where the space frame is fitted with the suspension, powertrain, electrical, interior and other componentry—the fully constructed space frame undergoes an advanced conversion coating process using a zirconium pre-treatment material and an e-coat process as an additional barrier to galvanic corrosion while maintaining a low environmental impact.<br> <br> The use of zirconium, an Acura and Honda company first, eliminates more than 90 percent of the waste byproduct that results from the use of more conventional zinc-phosphate material. This byproduct, which contains heavy metals, must be disposed of in landfills, creating a significant waste stream. The use of a zirconium conversion coating is part of the effort to create a manufacturing process with a low environmental impact, consistent with the ideal of a next-generation hybrid supercar.<br> <br> <strong>Body Repair and Serviceability</strong><br> <br> To assist in the ease and cost of collision repair, as well as to protect to a high degree the dimensional accuracy and integrity of the NSX space frame during a collision repair, the NSX development team worked closely with Acura service engineering team members to implement an overall modular construction concept: Space frame components can be purchased and replaced individually or as pre-assembled modular replacement sections. For example, there are \"light-collision\" and \"medium-collision\" replacement sections for both the front and rear sections of the vehicle, which are designed to minimize the amount of welding activity required.<br> <br> For extensive servicing of the powertrain (engine, rear motor and transaxle), the team designed a modular rear inner body section—once the rear fascia panel is removed, the entire trunk section of the vehicle can be removed as a single unit to permit easy and unrestricted access to the mid-mounted V-6 engine. The trunk structure also helps locate outer body panels.<br> <br> <strong>Safety and Driver-Assistive Technology</strong><br> <br> Providing for the safety of Acura customers and other road users has been a point of paramount importance for the Acura brand from its inception. Like all Acura vehicles, the 2017 Acura NSX starts with stable, precise and predictable driving dynamics—steering, handling and braking—as the foundation for active safety performance and collision avoidance. To provide a high-level of occupant protection in the event of a collision, the Acura NSX employs its advanced multi-material body design along with both primary and supplemental restraint systems, which work as a system to effectively manage the energy in a collision, minimizing cabin intrusion and mitigating occupant injury.<br> <br> The NSX\'s innovative multi-material space frame utilizes cast aluminum nodes—including a world\'s first application of ablation casting technology—and highly rigid extruded aluminum frame members for superior crashworthiness and occupant protection with light weight and high rigidity. The NSX also utilizes the world\'s first application of a three-dimensionally formed and water jet-quenched ultra-high-strength steel for its A-pillar construction, which offers robust structural rigidity including roof-crush performance.<br> <br> Furthermore, the multi-material space frame design and the packaging of hybrid componentry, including the vehicle\'s lithium-ion batteries and high-voltage systems, have also been optimized for both occupant protection and for the safety of emergency personnel (first responders).<br> <br> Standard primary and supplemental restraint systems include:<br> <br> Single-stage driver and dual-stage passenger multiple-threshold front airbags (SRS)<br> Driver knee airbag<br> Side airbags<br> Side curtain airbags with rollover sensor<br> Three-point seatbelts with a load-limited equipped automatic tensioning system<br> <br> Accompanying these passive safety technologies, an additional level of safety performance is afforded by these advanced active and passive safety technologies:<br> <br> Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) with Traction Control<br> Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) and Brake Assist<br> Multi-Angle Rearview Camera with Dynamic Guidelines<br> Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) with Location and Pressure Indicators<br> LED Daytime Running Lights<br> <br> <strong>Multi-Material Space Frame - Occupant and Component Protection</strong><br> <br> The NSX\'s aluminum-intensive multi-material space frame utilizes a combination of materials throughout the platform for high strength and rigidity in the event of a collision. The NSX\'s space frame construction consists of highly rigid aluminum extrusions, aluminum stampings, high-strength steel stampings, and ablation cast aluminum frame nodes (integrated with front and rear frame rails) which serve as critical components in the absorption and dispersion of energy in both front and rear impacts.<br> <br> Additional platform fortification and occupant safety performance is provided by the world\'s first automotive application of 3-dimensional bent and quenched ultra-high-strength A-pillars, which support the overall safety performance of the body, including roof-crush performance, while providing for outstanding forward visibility.<br> <br> <strong>Strength and Energy Absorption with Ablation Cast Nodes</strong><br> <br> To achieve improved occupant protection and crashworthiness, the NSX\'s body/chassis engineering team opted to use an all-new material technology—ablation cast nodes—over the design and fitment of traditional aluminum castings within the crumple zones of the multi-material space frame. The Acura NSX represents the world\'s first automotive application of this new casting technology.<br> <br> Ablation cast nodes have been fitted at key junctures within the front of the space frame to help optimize impact protection for the vehicle\'s occupants in the event of a collision. Strong and stout, these ablation cast nodes help to minimize overall vehicle weight while offering superior strength and tremendous ductility to facilitate energy absorption in a collision. An added benefit in the ablation casting process is the flexibility to tune the component\'s wall thickness for optimal weight, strength and deformability.<br> <br> The space frame\'s front nodes are designed to deform and in the process to absorb energy in a frontal collision, helping to minimize the transfer of kinetic energy to the cabin. Additionally, two ablation cast nodes in the rear frame are designed for ultimate rigidity to transfer crash energy into the extruded aluminum rear frame rails in order to mitigate the potential for forward movement of the rear power unit in the event of a rear collision.<br> <br> <strong>Ultra Thin, Ultra Strong A-Pillars Use World First Technology</strong><br> <br> Another innovative new technology application designed into the platform of the Acura NSX is the implementation of A-pillars composed of three-dimensionally formed, ultra-high-strength steel members. The fabrication method allows the pillars to be substantially smaller in cross section than conventional methods, greatly improving visibility while exceeding federal roof crush standards. This is the world\'s first application of the fabrication technology within the automotive industry.<br> <br> The A-pillar cross section, at 89 millimeters, is approximately 35 millimeters narrower than a part using a traditional stamped-steel construction method.<br> <br> <strong>Fuel Tank Design/Packaging</strong><br> <br> The NSX\'s 15.6 gallon fuel reservoir is a twin-tank system designed to enhance safety performance in the event of a rear-end collision. By using a twin-tank configuration, the design team was able to package the fuel tanks in the safest location possible—tucked neatly between the rear bulkhead and the engine.<br> <br> <strong>Intelligent Power Unit (IPU) Packaging</strong><br> <br> The Intelligent Power Unit (IPU), containing the vehicle\'s lithium-ion hybrid battery, is strategically packaged inside the cabin in front of the rear bulkhead, optimizing protection in the event of a frontal or rear collision. Further, the location helps protect the IPU from damage in a side impact by the use of highly rigid B-pillars and cross-car extrusion members. In testing the performance of this system, engineers went beyond standard government crash safety protocols for side impact performance, which engage the vehicles door structure (forward of the IPU) and tested a side pole impact occurring directly on the vehicle\'s B-pillar with no damage to the IPU/battery.<br> <br> <strong>Three-Point Seatbelts with Automatic Tensioning System</strong><br> <br> Both the driver and passenger seatbelts are equipped with an automatic tensioning system to help protect the vehicle\'s occupants in the event of a collision. When an impact occurs, the automatic tensioning system tightens the seatbelts (shoulder and lap) to help position the occupant firmly in the seat within the first few milliseconds of the collision. In the event of a severe, high-speed collision, if deceleration forces rise above a predetermined level, the automatic tensioning system will release a small length of seatbelt webbing to reduce the seatbelt retention force on the occupant, limiting peak restraining forces.<br> <br> <strong>Single-Stage Driver, Dual-Stage Passenger, Multiple-Threshold Front Airbags</strong><br> <br> Single-stage driver and dual-stage passenger, multiple threshold front airbags (SRS) offer superior safety performance for the vehicle\'s occupants. The SRS system is able to detect crash severity, seatbelt usage, and additional factors that allow for optimized deployment timing as well as the capability to inflate the dual-stage passenger airbag at different rates of expansion.<br> <br> The single-stage driver\'s airbag promotes early restraint while maintaining constant pressure by reducing airbag volume early and maximizing volume later in the deployment. Along with proper seatbelt use, the single-stage driver and dual-stage passenger multiple threshold front airbag system helps to reduce the chance for head/neck and upper body injuries in the event of a frontal collision. The front airbag system is neatly concealed, with the driver\'s airbag housed within the center of the steering wheel and the passenger\'s airbag seamlessly contained and hidden out of view within the dashboard. A great deal of time and effort was put into eliminating the seam around the passenger airbag in keeping with the quality execution and design aesthetic throughout the entire cabin.<br> <br> Depending upon the severity and direction of a collision, activation of the multiple threshold front airbags may occur independently of the deployment of side airbags or the side curtain airbags. In addition, the airbag system also uses sensors in the seat to assess the weight of the front passenger. The passenger airbag is shut off if the weight sensors indicate that an infant or small child is occupying the passenger seat, although the NSX is not recommended for passengers age 12 or younger.<br> <br> <strong>Driver Knee Airbag</strong><br> <br> The driver\'s knee airbag is designed to supplement the driver\'s single-stage airbag in the event of a frontal collision by helping keep the driver in proper position. The driver\'s knee airbag also provides improved packaging benefits. By utilizing an airbag instead of a knee bolster, the design team was able to provide improved knee clearance for the driver, aiding comfort and ease of vehicle ingress/egress.<br> <br> <strong>Side Airbags</strong><br> <br> Packaged within the driver and passenger seat side bolsters, the side airbags are designed to deploy and inflate quickly to maximize potential protection for properly-seated occupants, helping to protect the occupants\' upper body (thorax and pelvis) from injury, or evacuate (vent) expanding gases before fully inflating if an occupant is positioned in the airbag deployment path, helping to mitigate the potential for occupant injury from the airbag deployment.<br> <br> <strong>Side Curtain Airbags with Rollover Sensor</strong><br> <br> Mounted in the outboard roof area nearest to the door, side curtain airbags provide additional head and upper torso protection for the NSX\'s occupants in the event of a moderate-to-severe side impact or vehicle rollover. The side curtain airbags effectively cover the window area from the A-pillar back to the C-pillar.<br> <br> In the event of a rollover, a roll-rate sensor and multiple G sensors determine the rate of roll and deploy side curtain airbags at the correct moment for optimum protection. In the case of a rollover, the side curtain airbags on both sides of the vehicle will deploy. However, in the event of a moderate-to-severe side impact that does not result in a rollover, only the side-curtain airbag on the impacted side of the vehicle will deploy.<br> <br> <strong>Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) with Traction Control</strong><br> <br> Active vehicle safety and driving dynamics are enhance by the implementation of an advanced Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) with Traction Control system that can minimize traction loss or correct vehicle dynamics prior to it occurring, often before the driver even realizes.<br> <br> By continually monitoring key dynamic parameters and driver inputs such as steering angle, throttle position, yaw rate, lateral G-force, vehicle speed, and individual wheel speeds to detect an oversteer or understeer condition, the VSA with Traction Control system—working in conjunction with the Sport Hybrid SH-AWD system and the power unit—is able to instantaneously and unobtrusively redirect torque and/or invoke the ABS braking system at each wheel as needed to help stabilize the vehicle. What\'s more, it provides an additional level of safety performance by increasing tractability/reducing wheel spin in conditions with reduced traction such as while driving in wet, icy or snowy conditions.<br> <br> Developed through extensive testing on both road and track, the NSX engineering team has created a vehicle stability system that is highly effective while minimizing intrusion on the driving experience. In most instances, the VSA response is so quick and seamless that vehicle instability is likely to be corrected absent the driver\'s involvement or awareness.<br> <br> VSA is fully functional in the Quiet, Sport and Sport+ drive mode of the Integrated Dynamics System, but its dynamic performance is tuned accordingly, with progressive variations in its threshold of engagement and level of intervention. If desired, the driver can disable the VSA with Traction Control when operating the Acura NSX in the \"Track\" mode setting of the Integrated Dynamics System. Disabling VSA requires that the driver first select Track mode, which requires a deliberate, five-second holding of the Dynamic Mode dial, after which the driver must depress the VSA button on the left side of the instrument panel for an additional six seconds. Shutting off and restarting the vehicle will return the system to its default setting, with the VSA enabled.<br> <br> <strong>Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) and Brake Assist</strong><br> <br> The superlative deceleration performance offered by the Acura NSX\'s next-generation super sports brake system seamlessly melds both mechanical (friction) and regenerative braking systems for exceptional braking performance. Braking is further enhanced through a sports-oriented Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) and Brake Assist.<br> <br> By varying the amount of force of a vehicle\'s brakes at each individual wheel, Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) acts as an extension of the ABS by applying the optimal amount of braking force at each wheel to maximize vehicle stability while optimizing stopping power.<br> <br> As a further supplemental technology to the ABS and EBD, the Brake Assist system on the NSX provides an additional level of supplemental braking pressure when the driver attempts a hard or emergency stop.<br> <br> <strong>Multi-Angle Rearview Camera with Dynamic Guidelines</strong><br> <br> When Reverse gear is selected, the convenient Multi-Angle Rearview Camera with Dynamic Guidelines automatically displays one of three different real-time views—Normal, Wide-Angle and Top-Down—behind the vehicle on the Display Audio screen, allowing the driver to more precisely navigate when backing up. The driver can choose whether to display dynamic guidelines (lines that articulate with movement of the steering wheel to show the arc the vehicle will travel while backing up), fixed guidelines or no guidelines at all. The dynamic and fixed guidelines settings help indicate the clearance required while maneuvering.<br> <br> Normal View - helpful for surveying the area directly behind the vehicle while backing up or parking<br> Wide-Angle View - displays a nearly 180 degree perspective behind the NSX, perfect when backing out of a parking spot where it is difficult to see cross traffic or when parked between two tall vehicles<br> Top-Down View - offers a highly-detailed and close-up view immediately behind the vehicle, ideal for backing into tight confines<br> <br> If the last view mode used was Normal or Wide-Angle, that same mode will appear the next time the Reverse gear is selected. If Top-Down View was last used, it will revert to Wide-Angle View when used next.<br> <br> <strong>Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) with Location and Pressure Indicators</strong><br> <br> Every Acura NSX includes an onboard Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) with Location and Pressure Indicators that display the current tire pressure in pounds per square inch (psi) of each individual tire in a visual graphic shown on the center gauge cluster (in the Multi-Information Display)—an important safety feature for an ultra-high-performance supercar such as the new Acura NSX.<br> <br> Of note, the TPMS has different warning thresholds for both low- and high-speed operation, as track driving requires an elevated tire pressure.<br> <br> <strong>LED Daytime Running Lights (DRL)</strong><br> <br> The Acura NSX\'s LED daytime running lights (DRL) offer improved safety when driving the vehicle during daylight hours by allowing the vehicle to be seen earlier and more conspicuously by other drivers/pedestrians on the road.<br> <br> <strong>Front and Rear Parking Sensors</strong><br> <br> Available with the optional Technology Package, a front and rear parking sensor system, located on the outer front and rear perimeter of the vehicle, can alert the driver to an approaching obstacle. The parking sensors function in both Reverse as well as with forward vehicle motion at low speeds.','[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_9.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_10.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_11.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_12.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_13.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_14.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_15.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_16.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_17.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_18.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_19.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_20.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_21.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_22.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_23.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_24.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_25.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_26.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_27.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_28.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_29.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_30.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_31.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_32.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_33.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_34.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_35.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_36.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_37.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_38.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_39.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_40.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_41.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_42.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_43.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_44.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_45.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_46.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_47.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_4.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_5.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_6.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_7.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-NSX-5663_8.jpg\"]','2024-10-23 05:32:32','2024-10-23 05:32:32'),(20,'f5b58e57','https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/acura-ilx-2016.html',2,'ACURA ILX 2016-2018 Photos, engines &amp; full specs ','<p><strong>Acura improved the ILX in 2014 for the 2016 model-year and brought more power, better handling, and three trim levels to the market. Yet, it didn\'t make the fuss it intended.</strong></p><p></p><p>Based on the same platform as the tenth Civic generation, the ILX benefited from all the new technologies that came with Honda\'s compact sedan/hatchback. But since Acura was the premium sibling, it had to prove its price difference, so it came with a different powertrain than its mundane compact sibling.</p><p>Right from the start, it was easy to recognize the facelifted version thanks to the new LED headlights named Jewel Eye. The ILX also sported a new grille design and a more aggressive lower front bumper design, with an A-shaped but small, lower air intake flanked on the sides by impressively sized air-inlets that cooled the brakes. Moreover, on the sides, the carmaker added new side sills and, depending on the trim level, sets of 17\" or 18\" light-alloy wheels.</p><p>The 2012 ILX was well received by customers, but there were complaints about the sound insulation. Acura understood that a quieter cabin was preferred by its customers and added some weight due to the sound-deadening materials used. There were also upgrades on the materials and the infotainment system that sported a seven-inch touch-screen on the center stack.</p><p>But the most important addition was the introduction of the K24 engine under the ILX\'s hood, and it was mated to an 8-speed automatic transmission. That was something unavailable for the mundane Civic. Its all-wheel independent suspension with enhanced adaptive dampers offered the driver the possibility to soften or stiffen them.</p>','<strong>Starting with a manufacturer\'s suggested retail price (MSRP) of $27,900, the 2016 Acura ILX boasts more power, improved handling, more luxurious appointments and more youthful, sporty styling. The 2016 ILX also expands customer choice with three main grades - the standard ILX, the ILX with Premium Package, and the line-topping ILX Tech Plus Package, supplemented by the addition of the all-new AcuraWatch™ Plus and A-SPEC Packages.</strong><br> <br> The Acura ILX captures a higher percentage of young luxury buyers, under age 35, than any other vehicle in this growing entry-luxury sedan segment. The enhancements made to the 2016 model are designed to make the ILX even more attractive to upwardly mobile younger buyers looking for upmarket quality and performance.<br> <br> The ILX\'s new 2.4-liter, 16-valve, direct-injected DOHC i-VTEC engine produces peak output of 201 horsepower at 6,800 rpm and 180 lb.-ft. of torque at 3,600 rpm, up 51 horsepower and 40 lb.-ft. compared to the outgoing 2.0-liter engine. The new engine is mated to a new 8-speed dual clutch transmission (8DCT) with torque converter and paddle-controlled Sequential Sport Shift. The new 8DCT is the most advanced transmission in its competitive set, delivering incredibly quick, crisp and intuitive gear changes, including rev-matching down shifts, to achieve outstanding response and sporting performance with top-class fuel efficiency, with an EPA rating of 25/36/29 mpg city/hwy/combined.<br> <br> To make the most of its high performance new powertrain, steering responsiveness and linearity are improved via a retuned suspension and a number of chassis design enhancements. With these changes the 2016 ILX delivers an athletic, confident and balanced driving performance.<br> <br> With form following function, the reborn ILX sports a bolder, more distinctive front end highlighted by piercing Jewel Eye™ LED headlights, a new grille design, and more aggressive lower fascia; a restyled rear end offers new LED combination lights and lower fascia enhancements; and new 10-spoke 17-inch aluminum alloy wheels. The available ILX A-SPEC Package enhances the performance look even more by adding sporty side sill garnishes, a trunk spoiler, front fog lights, new 18-inch 10-spoke machined alloy wheels, and several unique interior appearance touches.<br> <br> Inside, the 2016 ILX is luxury-quiet, benefitting from additional noise-insulating materials, thicker front door glass, noise-attenuating wheels, and the adoption of Active Noise Control technology. Interior refinement continues with styling enhancements such as upgraded materials, contrasting Euro-style stitching on the steering wheel, parking-brake handle and shift knob, as well as new high-intensity silver trim for the instrument panel and other areas. The A-SPEC package enhances the exceptional cabin appeal and appointments with an exclusive Premium Black interior color scheme including a black headliner, perforated black Lux Suede® seat inserts, red instrument illumination, exclusive gray interior stitching and aluminum brake and throttle pedals.<br> <br> Adding luxury appointments to the sporty interior, the 2016 ILX offers an abundance of standard and available high-end features and technologies, including heated front seats, Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink®, Smart Entry/Push-Button Start keyless access system, one-touch turn signals, GPS-linked automatic climate control and LED accent lighting. A 7-inch On Demand Multi-Use Display™ (ODMD) touch screen (Premium and Tech Plus grades), located on the instrument-panel center stack, controls these and other features, and features contextual menus, displaying relevant items while minimizing instrument-panel clutter. The evolved touch-screen connectivity and media system receives more than 50 design changes to enhance intuitive operation and functionality.<br> <br> The ILX Tech Plus also features the next generation of AcuraLink®, Acura\'s cloud-based connected-car system, offering Acura owners a broad range of cloud-based and embedded convenience, connectivity and available security features. Siri™ Eyes Free is standard on Premium and higher grades. And Tech Plus grades can be equipped with the Acura Navigation System with 3D view, featuring and AcuraLink Real-Time Traffic™ with Traffic Rerouting.<br> <br> The Tech Plus grade with AcuraWatch™ and embedded Acura Navigation adds a color Multi-information Display (MID) between the tachometer and speedometer and Acura/ELS Studio® premium audio system along with the latest generation of AcuraLink connected-car technology. Also available for the first time (on the Premium Package) is a new tethered navigation system powered by the user\'s compatible iPhone and data plan via the AcuraLink navigation app. Premium models also get enhanced audio options, including SiruisXM® radio, HD Radio™, Pandora® and Aha™ integration, and HDMI connectivity.<br> <br> The 2016 ILX is newly available with the AcuraWatch™ suite of advanced safety and driver-assistive technologies, the most advanced system of its kind in the competitive set. AcuraWatch™ includes Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keeping Assist System, a Multi-View Rear Camera with Dynamic Guidelines, as well as Road Departure Mitigation and a Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (including Forward Collision Warning) with sensor fusion technology that enables new capabilities, including pedestrian sensing. AcuraWatch™ is standard on the Tech Plus Package and optional on the standard ILX. Premium and Tech Plus grades also get Acura\'s blind spot information and Cross Traffic Monitor feature.<br> <br> The ILX is equipped with Acura\'s next-generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure and is designed to achieve top safety ratings - a 5-Star Overall Vehicle Score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and a TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), including a GOOD rating in the IIHS\' small-overlap frontal collision test.<br> <br> Additional standard safety and driver-assistive features include Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) with traction control, an Expanded View Driver\'s Mirror, dual-stage, multiple-threshold front airbags, driver and front passenger SmartVent™ side airbags, side curtain airbags, a Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS), and pedestrian injury-mitigation design features.<br> <br> <strong>Powertrain</strong><br> <br> Acura\'s gateway sport sedan brings a new level of powertrain performance and sophistication to its segment as the 2016 ILX gains a completely new direct-injection (DI) engine, backed by an equally new and advanced dual-clutch automatic transmission-both playing a key role in challenging the notion of what \"gateway\" can mean. The new powertrain powers all iterations of the 2016 ILX.<br> <br> Replacing both the standard 2.0 and 2.4-liter engines in the 2015 ILX, the ILX\'s new Direct-Injection 2.4-liter DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine combines power with exceptional efficiency. It produces peaks of 201 horsepower and 180 lb.-ft. of torque-51 more horsepower and 40 lb.-ft. more torque than the outgoing 2.0-liter automatic transmission-equipped model. Compared to the 2.4-liter manual transmission model, the new ILX engine\'s maximum horsepower is the same but it arrives 200 rpm earlier at 6,800. Peak torque is up 10 lb.-ft., arriving at 3,600 rpm versus 4,400 rpm for the outgoing 2.0-liter with improvement across a broad speed range. The 2016 ILX also boasts fuel-economy ratings superior to both of the outgoing powertrains, with an EPA rating of 25/36/29 mpg city/hwy/combined.<br> <br> To make the most of its powerful, refined and efficient new engine, the ILX features a highly advanced new 8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) featuring Sequential SportShift. The DCT, with its closely-spaced ratios, ultra-quick shifts and automatic downshift rev-matching, gives the new ILX an aggressively sporting, yet refined feel. The torque converter provides exceptionally smooth operation in stop-and-go situations, plus it offers off-the-line torque multiplication for substantially improved initial acceleration that a DCT alone cannot equal.<br> <br> <strong>Direct-Injected 2.4-liter In-line 4-cylinder Engine</strong><br> <br> The ILX\'s new Direct Injection (DI) 2.4-liter DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine brings a host of intelligent technology to its segment. The engine\'s i-VTEC system combines VTC (Variable Timing Control), which continuously adjusts the intake camshaft phase, with Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC), which changes valve lift, timing and duration of the intake valves. Increased engine displacement, a new Direct Injection (DI) system, dual-stage intake manifold and other technologies combine to produce up to 40 lb.-ft. more torque with greater power available over the entire operating range, especially in the crucial mid-rpm area.<br> <br> Fuel economy ratings are exceptional, due in part to efficient Direct Injection, a new combustion-chamber design, offset cylinder bores and a range of friction-reducing technologies. The ILX has an EPA fuel-economy rating of 25/36/29 mpg city/hwy/combined. That\'s a significant increase over both the outgoing 2.0-liter and 2.4-liter engines, which were rated at 24/35/281 and 22/31/25, respectively. The new 4-cylinder engine also meets LEV III/ULEV125 emissions standards in select states, and Federal Tier 2, Bin 5 standards.<br> <br> <strong>Engine Block, Crankshaft and Pistons</strong><br> <br> The ILX\'s engine has a lightweight die-cast aluminum block with a single main-bearing cradle design that creates a rigid assembly to help minimize noise and vibration. Cast-in iron cylinder liners provide long-lasting durability. Each journal on the forged-steel crankshaft is micropolished to reduce internal friction. To improve smoothness throughout the rpm range and help lower noise levels, the engine is fitted with an internal balancer unit. Consisting of a pair of chain-driven counter-rotating shafts located in the lower block and integrated into the oil pan, the balancing system helps quell the inherent second-order harmonic vibrations that normally impact inline 4-cylinder engines.<br> <br> To reduce piston-sliding friction, the cylinder bores are offset by 8.0 mm from the crankshaft. This gives the connecting rods a more favorable angle during each power stroke, which reduces side loading on the pistons and in turn, improves efficiency. The engine features a forged crankshaft for high rigidity and low friction. Lightweight pistons have a carefully optimized skirt design to minimize reciprocating weight, and reduced weight minimizes vibration and increases operating efficiency. The piston crowns are dished, to help maintain stable combustion and to optimize distribution of the stratified fuel charge from the direct injector in each cylinder. This close control over the combustion process boosts overall operating efficiency.<br> <br> <strong>Dual-Stage Intake Manifold</strong><br> <br> To maximize power output, the engine has a dual-stage intake manifold with two different intake runner lengths that are selected based on the operating conditions. An actuator and a set of four butterfly valves control the intake-runner switching process. At low engine speeds, the long runners are used to improve low-end torque. At higher engine speeds the system switches to the short intake runners for greater high-rpm power. The result is intake tuning that is optimized for the engine\'s entire operating range.<br> <br> <strong>Cylinder Head and Valvetrain</strong><br> <br> The lightweight cylinder head is made of pressure-cast aluminum alloy, with exhaust passages cast directly into the cylinder head. This eliminates the need for a traditional separate exhaust manifold and allows the close-coupled catalytic converter to be mounted directly to the cylinder head.<br> <br> A silent chain drives the dual overhead cams and features a double-arm tensioner design that reduces operating friction. The cam drive is designed to be maintenance free throughout the life of the engine.<br> <br> To help boost fuel efficiency and power, the combustion chamber shape and valve angles have been optimized. The included valve angle is a narrow 35 degrees, which decreases the surface-to-volume ratio and helps create a flatter, more compact combustion chamber that reduces unburned hydrocarbon emissions. With this combustion chamber shape and the precise control of direct injection, the compression ratio set at 11.6:1.<br> <br> The cylinder head features a new \"tumble port\" intake design. In combination with the new combustion chamber and piston crown shape, the design\'s high level of airflow tumble helps create a homogenous fuel mixture for low fuel consumption and high airflow for high power output.<br> <br> <strong>i-VTEC Valve Control System</strong><br> <br> The ILX\'s DOHC 16-valve i-VTEC engine uses an advanced valve-control system to combine high power output with high fuel efficiency and low emissions. The system combines VTC (Variable Timing Control), which continuously adjusts the intake camshaft phase, with Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC), which changes valve lift, timing and duration of the intake valves.<br> <br> At low rpm, the VTEC intake valve timing and lift are optimized for high torque and low fuel consumption. As engine rpm builds past 4,900 rpm, the VTEC system transitions to a high-lift, long-duration intake cam profile for superior high-rpm engine power.<br> <br> The \"intelligent\" portion of the system is its ability to continuously vary the timing of the intake cam relative to that of the exhaust camshaft. This helps boost power and also provides a smoother idle (allowing idle speed to be reduced). The intake cam timing is varied based on input from sensors that monitor rpm, timing, throttle opening, cam position and exhaust air-fuel ratio. The result is increased fuel efficiency and lower NOx emissions.<br> <br> <strong>Cold-Air Induction System</strong><br> <br> To maximize power output, the ILX has a cold-air intake system that picks up engine induction air from the grille area at the front of the vehicle. Cooler intake air has greater density, which allows the direct-injection system to add proportionately more fuel for enhanced power output.<br> <br> <strong>Direct-Injection System</strong><br> <br> The ILX direct-injection system features a compact, high-pressure, injection pump that allows both high fuel flow and pulsation suppression, while variable pressure control optimizes injector operation. A multi-hole injector delivers fuel directly into each cylinder (not to the intake port, as in conventional port fuel-injection designs), allowing for more efficient combustion and greater power output.<br> <br> The multi-hole injectors help create the ideal stoichiometric fuel/air mixture in the cylinders for good emissions control. Theoretically, a stoichiometric mixture has just enough air to completely burn the available fuel. Based on the operating conditions, the direct-injection system alters its function for best performance. Upon cold engine startup, fuel is injected into the cylinders on the compression stroke. This creates a weak stratified charge effect that improves engine start-up and reduces exhaust emissions before a normal operating temperature is reached. For maximum power and fuel efficiency, fuel is injected during the intake stroke once the engine is fully warmed up. This helps create a more homogeneous fuel/air mix in the cylinder. This improves volumetric efficiency, and the cooling effect of the incoming fuel improves anti-knock performance.<br> <br> <strong>Drive-by-Wire™ Throttle System</strong><br> <br> The ILX Drive-by-Wire™ throttle system replaces a conventional throttle cable with smart electronics that \"connect\" the accelerator pedal to a throttle valve inside the throttle body. The result is less under-hood clutter and lower weight, as well as quicker and more accurate throttle actuation. Plus, a specially programmed \"gain\" rate between the throttle pedal and engine offers improved drivability and optimized engine response to suit specific driving conditions.<br> <br> Acura\'s Drive-by-Wire throttle system establishes the current driving conditions by monitoring throttle pedal position, throttle valve position, engine speed (rpm) and road speed. This information is used to define the throttle control sensitivity that gives the ILX\'s throttle pedal a predictable and responsive feel that meets driver expectations.<br> <br> <strong>Direct Ignition and Detonation/Knock Control</strong><br> <br> The ILX\'s Electronic Control Unit (ECU) monitors engine functions to determine the best ignition spark timing. Engine block-mounted acoustic detonation/knock sensors \"listen\" to the engine, and based on this input, the ECU can retard the ignition timing to prevent potentially damaging detonation. An ignition coil unit for each cylinder is positioned above each spark plug\'s access bore.<br> <br> <strong>Close-Coupled Catalysts</strong><br> <br> The exhaust manifold is cast directly into the ILX\'s aluminum cylinder head to reduce weight, decrease parts count, and create more under-hood space. The result of this casting design is that the primary catalytic converters are positioned much closer to the combustion chambers, enabling extremely rapid converter \"light-off\" after engine start. A significant weight savings is realized by eliminating traditional exhaust manifolds.<br> <br> <strong>Emissions Control</strong><br> <br> The 2016 ILX meets the tough EPA Tier 2/Bin 5 and CARB LEV III/ ULEV125 emissions standards, and is certified to this level of emissions performance for 120,000 miles. A number of advanced technologies are factors in the emissions performance. The unique cylinder head-mounted close-coupled catalytic converters light off more quickly after engine start up, and a 32-bit RISC microprocessor within the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) boosts computing power to improve the precision of spark and fuel delivery.<br> <br> The engine also features Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) that continually adjusts the fuel delivery to yield the best combination of power, low fuel consumption and low emissions. Multiple sensors constantly monitor critical engine operating parameters such as intake air temperature, ambient air pressure, throttle position, intake airflow volume, intake manifold pressure, coolant temperature, exhaust-to-air ratios, as well as the position of the crankshaft and the camshafts.<br> <br> <strong>Friction-Reducing Technologies</strong><br> <br> The ILX engine makes use of friction-reducing technologies designed to improve engine efficiency. The outer skirts of lightweight aluminum pistons feature a special coating that reduces overall friction as the pistons move within the cylinder bores. Plateau honing further lowers the friction level between the pistons and the cylinders by creating an ultra-smooth surface. Plateau honing is a 2-stage machining process that uses two grinding processes instead of the more conventional single honing process. This also enhances the long-term wear characteristics of the engine.<br> <br> <strong>One-Touch Start System</strong><br> <br> To ensure consistent starting, the ILX has a one-touch start system that maintains starter engagement until the engine starts. Should the driver release the Start button before the engine starts, the system will continue cranking to start the engine. Simply push the Start button (with a foot on the brake pedal and the fob in the vehicle)-the engine is designed to automatically start up.<br> <br> <strong>100,000+/- Mile Tune-up Intervals</strong><br> <br> The ILX\'s engine does not require scheduled maintenance for 100,000+/- miles or more, other than periodic inspections and normal fluid and filter replacements. The first tune-up includes water pump inspection, valve adjustment and installation of new spark plugs.<br> <br> <strong>Maintenance Minder™ System</strong><br> <br> To eliminate unnecessary service stops while ensuring that the vehicle is properly maintained, the ILX has a Maintenance Minder™ system that continually monitors the vehicle\'s operating condition. When maintenance is required, the driver is alerted via a message on the Multi-Information Display (MID).<br> <br> The Maintenance Minder™ system monitors operating conditions such as oil and coolant temperature along with engine speed to determine the proper service intervals. Depending on operating conditions, oil-change intervals can be extended to a maximum of 10,000 miles, potentially sparing the owner considerable expense and inconvenience over the life of the vehicle. The owner-resettable system monitors all normal service parts and systems, including oil and filter, tire rotation, air cleaner, automatic transmission fluid, spark plugs, timing belt, coolant, brake pads and more. To mitigate the potential for driver distraction, maintenance alerts are presented on the MID only when the ignition is first turned on, not while driving.<br> <br> <strong>Sequential SportShift 8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) with Torque Converter</strong><br> <br> To maximize performance and fuel efficiency, the 2016 ILX has a standard 8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT), in which one clutch controls the odd gears while the other clutch controls the even gears. This arrangement allows automatic or manual gear changes with a much smaller interruption in power to the wheels, resulting in millisecond-quick shifts. In addition, the DCT\'s efficient power transmission and wider overall ratio range contribute to the ILX\'s substantial gain in fuel efficiency. Compared to a conventional manual transmission, the operation of the clutches and shifting mechanisms are electronically controlled, eliminating the need for a clutch pedal or manual shift lever. The DCT with its closely spaced ratios, ultra-quick shifts and automatic downshift rev-matching, gives the ILX an exhilarating and sporty feel. The DCT transmission in the ILX also features a steering wheel-mounted paddle-shifter system that lets the driver take manual control of transmission gear selection, further heightening the driving experience.<br> <br> The ultra-thin torque converter complements the efficient operation of the DCT by providing exceptionally smooth operation in stop-and-go situations, plus it offers off-the-line torque multiplication for improved initial acceleration that a DCT alone can\'t equal. In an aggressive standing-start launch, the torque converter substantially improves initial acceleration.<br> <br> <strong>Cooperative Transmission Control</strong><br> <br> Both shift performance and smoothness are improved by cooperative control between the Drive-by-Wire throttle system and the transmission. The engine is throttled by the engine management system during upshifts and downshifts, thus the function of the engine and transmission can be closely choreographed for faster, smoother shifting. As a result, the peak g-forces (or \"shift shock\") are reduced significantly during upshifts and downshifts.<br> <br> <strong>Automatic Modes</strong><br> <br> The ILX transmission can be operated in two different, fully automatic modes that are controlled by the shift lever. In Drive (D) mode, the transmission combines fuel efficiency with smooth operation and responsive power when needed. When Sport (S) mode is selected, the transmission switches to more aggressive mapping that puts the emphasis on performance-oriented driving, with higher engine rpm for greater acceleration and response.<br> <br> <strong>Smart Transmission Logic</strong><br> <br> The ILX transmission incorporates an advanced Grade Logic Control System, Shift Hold Control and Cornering G Shift Control - all of which reduce unwanted shifting and gear hunting. The result is smart transmission operation that optimizes fuel efficiency and keeps the transmission in the appropriate gear for driving conditions, generating excellent performance and smooth operation.<br> <br> While ascending or descending hills, Grade Logic Control alters the transmission\'s shift schedule to reduce shift frequency and improve speed control. The transmission ECU continually measures throttle position, vehicle speed and acceleration/deceleration to determine when the vehicle is on a hill. The shift schedule is then adjusted - during ascents to hold the transmission in lower gears to boost climbing power, and during descents to provide greater engine braking.<br> <br> Shift Hold Control keeps the transmission in its current (lower) gear ratio during aggressive driving, as in the case of decelerating at a corner entry. Shift Hold Control leaves the chassis undisturbed by eliminating excess shifting and ensures that power will be immediately available (without a downshift) at the corner exit. Cornering G Shift Control monitors the vehicle lateral acceleration to determine when the ILX is turning. When the system detects sufficient cornering speed, it will suppress any unwanted upshifts. This prevents the transmission from upshifting during a corner, which could upset the chassis balance thus requiring downshifting again at the corner exit when the throttle is applied.<br> <br> <strong>Paddle Shifter Operation in Drive Modes</strong><br> <br> While in Drive mode, special transmission logic programming allows the use of the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. When the driver operates the paddle shifters, the transmission responds to the driver\'s shift command and then returns to its normal fully automatic mode if further paddle shift inputs are not made within a given time. This special logic makes it easy for the driver to command a quick downshift without leaving the convenience of Drive mode.<br> <br> <strong>Paddle Shifter Operation in Sport Mode</strong><br> <br> When Sport is selected with the shifter, a pull on the racing-inspired paddle shifters (mounted on the steering wheel) places the transmission in fully manual mode until another mode of operation is selected. A digital display in the instrument cluster indicates which gear the transmission is in.<br> <br> A double-kick-down feature lets the driver command a sport-minded double downshift - such as from Fifth to Third gear. By pulling on the left downshift paddle twice in rapid succession, the transmission will drop directly to the chosen lower gear ratio. The Drive-by-Wire throttle system also creates a \"blip\" of the throttle to help match gear speeds while downshifting.<br> <br> To prevent harm to the powertrain when the transmission is paddle shifted by the driver (including during double-kick-down shifts), the system will inhibit potentially damaging shifts. As an added safety measure, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) can also cut off fuel to the engine to prevent over-revving. On downshifts, the transmission will not execute a driver command that will over-rev the engine.<br> <br> <strong>Body</strong><br> <br> The 2016 ILX boasts dynamic new front and rear styling cues, including standard Jewel Eye™ LED headlights, combination LED taillights and available upsized wheels and tires. The new LED headlights and taillights are complemented by a new design Acura grille and front and rear fasciae. Sleek, sporty and aerodynamically efficient, the new Acura ILX exterior simultaneously combines themes of luxury, performance and efficiency. The new A-SPEC Package, available on Premium and Tech Plus models, gains 18-inch 10-spoke machined-face alloy wheels, fog lights, sporty side sill garnish and a deck lid spoiler. The Acura ILX delivers both with its wide stance, long nose and a short tail that are keen-edged and individualistic, aerodynamically efficient, and immediately recognizable as an Acura.<br> <br> <strong>Design Concept</strong><br> <br> The ILX\'s keen-edged design is simultaneously edgy and fluid, with dynamic forms and expressive lines flowing from the front of the signature Acura grille, along the body sides and across the three-dimensional cabin to the crisply styled trunk.<br> <br> The latest evolution of Acura\'s bold shield grille features a slimmer satin-finish center bar. Flanking the grille are new Jewel Eye® LED headlights, a first for the entry premium segment. Each headlight features five LED clusters that sweep outboard from the edges of the new grille and wrap into the fenders. Vertically-faceted side marker lights and reflectors are positioned at the outer edges of each headlight cluster.<br> <br> Below the grille is a new design front fascia with an aerodynamically tailored lower edge and wider center recess along with a pair of taller outboard recesses with a honeycomb grille design. Models equipped with the A-SPEC Package include fog lights.<br> <br> The long aluminum hood has a central character line that flows from the top of the grille back to the windshield. Narrow A-pillars afford good front visibility through the new acoustic glass windshield.<br> <br> All ILX models feature body-color side mirrors. The door windows are surrounded by satin trim that groups the windows together and visually elongates the cabin shape.<br> <br> Broad front fenders and pronounced front and rear wheel arches lend the ILX an athletic presence. The fenders are highlighted with crisp-edged flares that further emphasize the ten-spoke wheel design (18-inch diameter on Premium and Tech Plus models with the A-SPEC Package and 17-inch on all others).<br> <br> The most prominent character line on the ILX starts behind the front wheel arches and then rises as it flows rearward through the front door handle, over the rear door handle and rear wheel arches, and finally toward the deck lid. This rising character line imparts a sense of muscularity and motion, even when the ILX is at rest. At the bottom of the doors lies an additional character line - a deeply set three-dimensional element that provides a look of solidity at the base of the body.<br> <br> The rear of the cabin emphasizes the appearance of the wheel arches and compliments the strong, wide rear fenders. The taillight array wraps around the rear fenders and extends onto the back of the deck lid. The backup lights are located on the deck lid and the CHMSL is located at the top of the rear window. Models equipped with the A-SPEC Package are distinguished by a deck lid spoiler that further improves fuel efficiency.<br> <br> <strong>Aerodynamic Efficiency</strong><br> <br> The ILX\'s aerodynamic refinement provides benefits including high fuel efficiency, interior quietness, handling stability and low emissions. Numerous engineering details contribute to the ILX\'s aerodynamic qualities, starting with its sleek surfaces and keen edges, progressing to its nearly full underbody panels.<br> <br> Front Fascia - A spoiler located at the lower edge of the front fascia reduces aerodynamic drag and lift, which improves steering feel at high speeds.<br> Front Bumper Cover - Optimizing the front bumper corner shape reduces aerodynamic drag at the front tires.<br> A Pillars - Streamlined A-pillars reduce turbulence, aerodynamic drag and wind noise.<br> Wheel Strakes - Located ahead of the front and rear wheels, special aero strakes help move air smoothly around the tires, reducing side aerodynamic drag.<br> Full Undercover - To smooth airflow underneath the ILX, an undercover starts behind the front fascia, extends under the engine, cabin and fuel tank, while also covering the open space behind the rear suspension and beneath the trunk.<br> Rear Deck Lid Spoiler (A-SPEC Package) - Helps air separate cleanly off the back of the vehicle, resulting in a lower aerodynamic drag and improved stability at higher speeds.<br> <br> <strong>Outward Visibility</strong><br> <br> The swept-back position and narrow dimensions of the A-pillars result in a wide 84-degree front windshield view angle. The rear sightlines are improved due to the location of the CHMSL at the roofline rather than on the rear parcel shelf.<br> <br> <strong>Rigid Unit-Body Construction</strong><br> <br> The ILX utilizes a rigid unit body that offers outstanding ride and handling characteristics, as well as low interior noise levels. The upper part of the instrument panel, A- and C-pillars, floor area and rear trunk surround are designed for maximum strength with low weight. The body\'s high torsional stiffness contributes to ride comfort and handling precision that have long been Acura hallmarks. Among the notable unit body structural elements are:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>Advanced computer modeling ensures maximum unit body stiffness with minimal weight, resulting in peak ride and handling qualities with low weight and high fuel efficiency</li>     <li>Smooth load flows are particularly important for maintaining structural strength throughout the body. Particular emphasis on load flow was made at these areas:</li>     <li>Lower B-pillars</li>     <li>Lower C-pillars</li>     <li>Rear wheel houses</li>     <li>Floor panel</li>     <li>Lower corners of the front bulkhead</li>     <li>Side of the parcel shelf</li>     <li>Rear suspension spring base</li>     <li>Floor tunnel</li>     <li>Rear floor cross member</li>     <li>Mid floor cross member</li> </ul> <br> Further development of this concept for 2016 again enhances body rigidity and contributes to improved ride quality. Among the changes this year are stiffened B-pillars, an added floorpan tunnel brace and cross member, and stiffeners in the C-pillar, rear wheelhouse, side sills and rear parcel shelf. These and other changes help increase the robustness of the ILX body structure and occupant collision protection, including a targeted GOOD rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety small-overlap frontal crash test.<br> <br> <strong>High-Strength Steel</strong><br> <br> For high strength that fosters long-term durability, the Acura ILX utilizes high-strength steel (HSS) in more than 50 percent of its body structure. This high-grade, high-tensile steel provides the required strength for these enhancements without adding excessive weight, which in turn improves the ILX\'s steering and handling precision, while also enhancing fuel economy.<br> <br> Various grades of steel are used in different areas of the body according to need. These include:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>780 and 980 grade HSS - Inside sill, front floor cross member, front damper extension, etc. (for 8% of the unit body)</li>     <li>590 grade HSS - Used for most structural load paths for ACE™, including front side frame, front floor frame, center tunnel frame, mid-floor cross member, rear frame and center pillar stiffener (for 38% of the unit body)</li>     <li>440 grade HSS - Dashboard lower panel, rear damper base, etc. (for 4% of the unit body)</li>     <li>270 grade steel - Outer skin panels, floor panels, etc. (for 42% of the unit body)</li> </ul> <br> <strong>Aluminum</strong><br> <br> Aluminum stampings are used in certain locations to reduce the ILX\'s curb weight, which provides additional benefits in handling and fuel efficiency. Among the aluminum body components are the hood and front bumper beam.<br> <br> <strong>Next-Generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ Body Structure</strong><br> <br> The 2016 ILX employs the Next-Generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure. This uses a network of interconnected structural elements, now employing an even greater amount of high-tensile steel to absorb and distribute crash energy in the passenger compartment. This enhanced frontal crash energy management can also help to more evenly disperse the forces transferred to other vehicles in a crash. Additionally, Next-Generation ACE helps minimize the potential for under-ride or over-ride situations that can happen during frontal impacts should the ILX collide with another vehicle of a different size.<br> <br> <strong>Collision Safety Targets</strong><br> <br> The 2016 ILX is designed to more efficiently absorb and dispense the energy in a frontal collision and targets a 5-Star Overall Vehicle Score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and a TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating from the Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), including a targeted GOOD rating in the IIHS small-overlap frontal crash test.<br> <br> <strong>Cargo Area</strong><br> <br> The ILX trunk area features a wide opening and low lift-over height for easy loading and removal of items. The trunk interior is cleanly designed with smoothly finished hinges and premium panel fit. Inside is a high-quality molded lining. A temporary spare tire is located under the trunk floor panel.<br> <br> The trunk cargo volume is 12.4 cubic feet, or 12.3 cubic feet with the Premium, Tech Plus and A-SPEC packages. The ILX can accommodate a significant amount of bulky cargo, including three golf bags, two large traditional suitcases, a large cooler or a wheelchair. When more space is needed for cargo, the one-piece fold-down rear seatback can be lowered to reveal a cargo pass-through to the rear seat area.<br> <br> <strong>NVH Design Features</strong><br> <br> Extensive measures have been utilized to eliminate noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) from the passenger cabin of the ILX. Extensive analysis of systems and components - from the engine and transmission and their mounting systems, to the unit body, chassis and interior - result in a reduction in NVH in all operating parameters, particularly at highway cruising speeds. Key design elements include:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>Vibration Mitigation</li>     <li>Special attenuation for engine and transmission mounts, steering and suspension systems</li>     <li>Increased isolation for side engine mount and transmission mount</li>     <li>Sound-reduction air intake system</li>     <li>Body vibration damping system</li>     <li>Rigid floor panels</li>     <li>Low-vibration radiator support</li>     <li>Stiffeners in rear body panels and trunk</li>     <li>Highly rigid floor areas</li>     <li>Sound-absorbing Materials</li>     <li>Front inner fender insulators</li>     <li>Carpet mass tuned for maximum noise absorption</li>     <li>Rear body tray insulator</li>     <li>Tuned insulator panels</li>     <li>Sound absorbing rear inner fender materials</li>     <li>Noise attenuator added to wheels</li>     <li>Urethane rear fender bulkhead inserts</li>     <li>Noise-insulating rear parcel shelf lining</li>     <li>Sound-absorbing Glass</li>     <li>4.5 mm acoustic windshield glass</li>     <li>Thicker, 5 mm front door glass</li>     <li>3.5 mm rear door glass</li>     <li>Full-width sealer at bottom of windshield</li>     <li>Sealers and Insulators</li>     <li>Floor melt sheet with plastic constraining layer located beneath the seating area and rear body area</li>     <li>Broad use of Thinsulate™ insulating material</li> </ul> <br> <strong>Active Noise Control</strong><br> <br> Now standard on all ILX models, Active Noise Control captures low-end drivetrain frequencies entering the cabin, and then creates a precisely timed reverse-phase audio signal to cancel them. The result is a reduction in exhaust booming noise as well as road noise. Overall, a substantial 10-dB reduction in unwanted noise is attained.<br> <br> <strong>Jewel Eye® LED Headlights</strong><br> <br> New Jewel Eye® light-emitting diode (LED) headlights with an Auto On/Off feature replace the projector-beam halogen headlights and HID headlights on previous ILX models. Creating a dramatic new light signature, the Jewel Eye LED headlights are arrayed in sweeping diagonal lines running from the new grille\'s center bar and wrapping into the fenders. Each Jewel Eye unit is composed of five large high-output full LED clusters. The three outermost LED lights are utilized for low beams, while the innermost two are dedicated as high beams. LEDs are also deployed for the daytime running light (DRL) function, with a light pipe that runs along the bottom edge of the five headlamps. Altogether, they create a dramatic and distinctive appearance with superior lighting capability.<br> <br> <strong>Light Distribution</strong><br> <br> Both the low- and separate high-beam LED headlights offer outstanding performance in all nighttime driving conditions, including highway, winding roads, intersections, and in inclement weather conditions. The result is that the driver can see further with uniformity, making high-speed nighttime driving easier and less fatiguing.<br> <br> LED headlights offer a brighter light than halogens and a warmer tone than HIDs. The full LED headlights produce light at around 5500 kelvin, which is close to the color of natural sunlight. LED headlights allow drivers to perceive contrast more easily, thus reducing eye strain.<br> <br> A summary of LED benefits include:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>Outstanding light distribution</li>     <li>Excellent distant illumination performance</li>     <li>Clear illumination of the road surface and white lines</li>     <li>High visibility of the entire visible color spectrum (white, red, green, blue and yellow) compared to HID and halogen headlights</li>     <li>Response time when switching between low and high beam is shortened</li>     <li>Light congruity is improved between low and high beams</li> </ul> <br> <strong>Power Savings</strong><br> <br> Because LED headlights are efficient light producers, they require less power than conventional halogen bulbs. This reduces the car\'s charging system load, helping to save fuel and reduce CO2 emissions. Using just 47 watts total, the ILX\'s LED headlights use 57 percent less power than traditional halogen headlights, contributing to the ILX\'s overall operating efficiency.<br> <br> <strong>Long Lasting</strong><br> <br> Besides producing better light characteristics with lower energy usage, the ILX\'s LED headlights are longer lasting. With an estimated life expectancy of 10,000 hours, the LED headlights are projected to last up to five times longer than HID headlights and up to 10 times longer than traditional halogen headlight bulbs - contributing to less frequent replacement and potential cost savings. Further, their compact packaging allow for an improved aerodynamic frontal design.<br> <br> Many states now require the headlights to illuminate when the wipers are operating, so the ILX headlights are linked to the windshield wipers. When the driver activates the windshield wipers the headlights automatically illuminate, even during the daytime. The instrument panel lighting does not dim as it would during nighttime headlight illumination, however. This assures consistent high visibility of the gauges. The headlights stay illuminated for a short time after the wipers are switched off.<br> <br> <strong>Combination LED Taillights</strong><br> <br> LED taillights are part of the ILX\'s comprehensive exterior lighting array. Highly stylized to compliment the ILX body design, they are also brighter than traditional incandescent-bulb taillights, with a longer projected lifespan. Use of LEDs allows the addition of a \"light pipe\" styling element extending across the center of the lenses, contributing to the ILX\'s unique blend of design and engineering. The ILX taillight system features incandescent bulbs for the turn signal and back-up lights, and LED illumination for the Center High Mount Stop Lamp (CHMSL).<br> <br> <strong>Windshield Wipers</strong><br> <br> Positioning the ILX\'s windshield wipers below the rear edge of the hood line keeps them out of the driver\'s normal sightline for improved forward visibility. In addition, the wipers are positioned out of the airflow going over the hood to help reduce turbulence that can contribute to unwanted aerodynamic drag and interior noise.<br> <br> <strong>One-Touch Turn Signals</strong><br> <br> The ILX turn signals feature a simplified activation to simplify lane changes. One quick, light push on the turn-signal stalk blinks the turn signals three times- a typical number required for lane changes. The turn signals may be fully activated in the typical manner (by pushing the stalk past its detent), which will activate the signals until cancellation occurs.<br> <br> <strong>Side Mirrors</strong><br> <br> Aerodynamically shaped side mirror housings minimize turbulence and reduce wind noise. The mirror housings are body colored for a more integrated appearance. All models include as standard power-actuated mirrors that are heated. The heating elements help remove condensation, ice and snow that would hinder rearward vision and are switched on whenever the rear defroster button is depressed.<br> <br> <strong>Expanded-View Driver\'s Mirror</strong><br> <br> The ILX features a new expanded view side mirror on the driver-side door. As required by law, the main area of the mirror uses a traditional flat reflective plane on the inner portion of the mirror (that is closest to the door), while the outer portion of the mirror uses a convex element to provide a broader field of view. The convex portion of the mirror generates an additional 6.5 degrees of visibility that can assist the driver in detecting other vehicles that might not have otherwise been seen in a traditional side mirror.<br> <br> <strong>Fuel Tank</strong><br> <br> Located forward of the multi-link rear suspension, the fuel tank is constructed of polyethylene for reduced weight and lower evaporative emissions. The molded composite design also allows for a 13.2-gallon fuel capacity. The tank also incorporates a returnless fuel supply system that helps reduce vapor generation and reduces overall weight.<br> <br> <strong>Keyless Access System</strong><br> <br> All ILX models feature the Keyless Access System with smart entry and pushbutton ignition. The system has a unique digital identity that lets the ILX owner gain access to the car without having to unlock it with the remote transmitter or a conventional key. With the Keyless Access Remote in his or her possession, the car will be unlocked automatically when the driver pulls one of the front door handles.<br> <br> Once the door is opened and the driver is seated, the system allows the engine to be started by depressing the brake pedal and pushing the Engine Start/Stop button positioned on the instrument panel.<br> <br> When leaving the car, a press of the soft-touch button on the outside of either front door handle simultaneously locks all the doors. Alternatively, a press of the Lock button on the Keyless Access Remote will simultaneously lock all the doors.<br> <br> <strong>Remote Engine Start</strong><br> <br> Bi-Directional Keyless Remote Engine Start is available as an accessory for U.S. customers. The feature is a convenience for owners who may desire to warm up the interior and defrost the windows on a cold day or cool down the cabin with the A/C system in hot weather before driving away. After pressing the lock button on the special bi-directional keyless remote, the owner starts the engine with a 1-second push of the engine-start button on the remote.<br> <br> <strong>Multi-View Rear Camera</strong><br> <br> All ILX models feature a multi-view rear camera. The standard ILX displays its image on the 5-inch display in the instrument panel, while the ILX with the Premium or Tech Plus Package present the rearward view on the 8-inch W-VGA color navigation monitor. The driver can select among a choice of top view, normal view or wide view.<br> <br> When the ILX transmission is placed in Reverse, the view from a rear-mounted camera is displayed. To make it easier for the driver to judge distance and clearance, solid yellow on-screen guidelines indicate width, as well as distances of approximately 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 meters (approximately 0.5, 1, 2 and 3 yards) as measured from the rear of the ILX.<br> <br> The primary view is \"Normal View,\" which delivers about 130 degrees of rearward visibility. For special conditions, there is the \"Wide View,\" which delivers some 180 degrees of rearward visibility. The \"Top View\" generates a straight-down look at the area just rearward of the bumper, thus easing maneuvering in tight parking spaces.<br> <br> <strong>Exterior Colors</strong><br> <br> Six colors add drama and personality to the 2016 ILX. Making its debut on the ILX is an all-new color for Acura: Catalina Blue Pearl.<br> <br> <ul>     <li>White Orchid Pearl</li>     <li>Slate Silver Metallic</li>     <li>Graphite Luster Metallic</li>     <li>Crystal Black Pearl</li>     <li>Catalina Blue Pearl</li>     <li>Basque Red Pearl</li> </ul> <br> <strong>Body Accessories</strong><br> <br> A line of Acura Genuine Accessories was developed simultaneously with the ILX to provide vehicle personalization for owners. As with all Acura Genuine Accessories, ILX accessories are covered by a 4-year/50,000-mile limited warranty if purchased and installed by the dealer at the time of original vehicle purchase. Available accessories include:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>Unique 18-inch aluminum alloy wheels</li>     <li>Front underbody spoiler</li>     <li>Rear underbody spoiler</li>     <li>Side underbody spoiler</li>     <li>Body side molding</li>     <li>Rear decklid spoiler</li>     <li>Rear appliqué</li>     <li>Door edge guards</li>     <li>Car cover</li>     <li>Splash guards</li>     <li>Wheel locks</li>     <li>Fog lights</li>     <li>Remote engine starter</li>     <li>Engine block heater</li>     <li>XM Radio installation kit</li> </ul> <br> <strong>Chassis</strong><br> <br> The Acura ILX is engineered from the ground up to be a refined, responsive and driver-involving premium sports sedan. All ILX models feature Acura\'s highly developed MacPherson strut front and multi-link rear suspension systems, Amplitude Reactive Dampers, Motion-Adaptive Electric Power Steering, and Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) electronic stability control system that works with the ILX\'s Drive-by-Wire™ throttle system and 4-channel ABS systems to enhance vehicle control.<br> <br> The ILX\'s 4-wheel independent suspension is likewise tuned to provide a sporty, confidence-inspiring and dynamic driving experience, and the standard Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) with Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) and Brake Assist uses 4-wheel disc brakes.<br> <br> <strong>Inspired Handling</strong><br> <br> A 105.1-inch wheelbase, wide front and rear track dimensions, advanced suspension design along with features such as VSA® with Motion-Adaptive Electric Power Steering (EPS) help give the ILX inspired handling. Specially tuned independent front and rear suspension provides quick and smooth steering response, along with agile and linear handling.<br> <br> <strong>Suspension Systems</strong><br> <br> The Acura ILX uses MacPherson struts on the front with a rear multi-link suspension system at the rear. The strut-style front suspension is a space-efficient design that provides excellent handling characteristics with sophisticated ride quality, while also making room available for crash reinforcement at the front of the vehicle. Likewise, the multi-link rear suspension provides outstanding ride and handling characteristics, while also helping to maximize second-row seating and cargo space. Suspension geometry is also optimized for nimble handling.<br> <br> Acura suspension technologies employed in the 2016 ILX include:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>Amplitude Reactive Dampers (reduces damping forces over small-amplitude road imperfections)</li>     <li>Rebound springs (for both front and rear suspensions)</li>     <li>Low-friction bushings (further improves ride quality in small-amplitude impacts)</li> </ul> <br> <strong>MacPherson Strut Front Suspension</strong><br> <br> The MacPherson strut front suspension provides precise and engaging handling performance, a responsive feel for the driver, and luxurious ride quality. Specially tuned bushings along with performance-calibrated geometry ensure optimal wheel alignment while turning for confident handling. A 20-mm diameter tubular front stabilizer bar helps reduce body roll for less body lean in corners.<br> <br> <strong>Multi-Link Rear Suspension</strong><br> <br> The ILX uses a multi-link rear suspension that features stamped-steel upper A-arms, cast-aluminum knuckles, double lower tubular lateral links, tubular-steel toe-control links, coil-over dampers and a stabilizer bar. The system provides excellent handling, a flat ride and excellent control of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH). A solid rear stabilizer bar, increased in diameter from 14 to 15 mm for 2016, helps reduce understeer and improve steering response.<br> <br> <strong>Amplitude-Reactive Dampers</strong><br> <br> Acura\'s Amplitude-Reactive Dampers provide a superior level of ride comfort together with linear, agile handling. The dampers operate in two distinct performance parameters: a Ride Zone and a Handling Zone. Each zone has a unique set of compression and rebound damping forces tailored to provide the desired ride and handling attributes. In essence, the amplitude-reactive dampers operate as two separate damper systems combined in one. These dampers are entirely mechanical in operation with no electronic systems or driver involvement required.<br> <br> <strong>Ride Zone</strong><br> <br> On smooth and relatively smooth road surfaces, where the vertical suspension travel is short, the dampers provide a reduced damping effect to deliver an extremely comfortable ride.<br> <br> <strong>Handling Zone</strong><br> <br> On rough or uneven road surfaces or during spirited cornering, where the vertical suspension travel is greater, a second damping circuit is engaged. Here the damping effect is maximized for enhanced steering feel, improved body-roll control and more secure handling.<br> <br> With the Amplitude-Reactive Dampers, by adding a second spring floating valve above a conventional main piston valve, the ILX is able to maintain the superior driving dynamics.<br> <br> <strong>Low-Friction Bushings</strong><br> <br> Reducing the hysteresis of the lower front and rear suspension bushings helps improve ride quality during small-amplitude road imperfections without sacrificing steering precision, handling response or ride quality under strenuous cornering or rough road conditions. The front lower control-arm bushings are sleeved on 2016 models to further reduce compliance and improve steering response. Front and rear stabilizer bars utilize friction-reducing Teflon bushings for smooth and effective operation.<br> <br> <strong>Stiffer Body Structure and Front Subframe</strong><br> <br> The Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body structure provides a solid foundation for the ILX\'s suspension and steering systems to operate. For 2016, stiffeners, braces and patches added to the roof pillars, floorpan, sills, rear wheelhouses and rear package tray further enhance body rigidity. The front subframe is also stiffened in key areas to improve steering response.<br> <br> <strong>Motion-Adaptive Electric Power Steering (EPS)</strong><br> <br> The Motion-Adaptive Electric Power Steering (EPS) works with the Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) to offer a direct feeling and efficient steering performance, together with improved active safety. Using vehicle speed and steering angle data, Motion-Adaptive EPS works with Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) and Electric Power Steering to detect instability in low traction conditions (both during cornering and under braking) and automatically initiates steering inputs aimed at prompting the driver to steer in the correct direction. This new advanced technology supports the driver\'s action in operating the vehicle more safely and comfortably.<br> <br> Noted below are three examples of how Motion-Adaptive Electric Power Steering (EPS) works as part of VSA®:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>Mitigates Understeer: Helps correct the steering inputs to mitigate understeer and help the driver trace the intended curve of the road</li>     <li>Mitigates Oversteer: Helps correct the steering inputs to mitigate oversteer and help the driver trace the intended curve of the road</li>     <li>Stabilizes Braking: Helps correct the driver\'s steering input to reduce vehicle instability when the driver is braking hard on road surfaces with different friction coefficients (such as pavement that is only partially covered with dirt or snow)</li> </ul> <br> With Electric Power Steering (EPS), a sophisticated electric power-assisted rack-and-pinion steering system takes the place of a conventional hydraulic power steering system. EPS responds instantly to steering input and automatically changes the amount of power assist appropriate to the vehicle\'s speed.<br> <br> The Motion-Adaptive EPS system consists of a rack-and-pinion steering gear with an electric motor installed concentrically around the steering rack. To control the level of assist the Powertrain Control Module receives signals from a speed sensor and, coupled with a steering sensor for torque and rotation, then calculates the optimal amount of assist and sends a signal to the electric motor.<br> <br> When compared to the operation of a conventional hydraulic pump power steering system, the simpler Motion-Adaptive EPS increases efficiency because it does not draw a continuous amount of power directly from the engine. Other advantages of electric power-assisted steering include its lower power consumption (which helps improve fuel efficiency), and its compactness (and resulting lower overall weight).<br> <br> <strong>New Angular Acceleration Control Logic for EPS</strong><br> <br> For 2016, angular acceleration control logic is applied to the Motion-Adaptive Electric Power Steering to improve steering feel. This refinement helps to deliver a natural feeling effort buildup in response to steering turn-in.<br> <br> <strong>4-Wheel Disc Brakes with Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS)</strong><br> <br> All Acura ILX models are equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes with 4-channel ABS, Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) and Brake Assist.<br> <br> ABS independently modulates braking power at each wheel to help the driver retain steering control during heavy deceleration. EBD automatically optimizes braking force between the front and rear wheels, adjusting for the weight and loading of passengers and cargo, to provide stable and confident braking performance. EBD also provides excellent pedal feel and reduced brake fade under strenuous driving conditions. Brake Assist recognizes emergency braking situations and assists the driver by helping apply full braking force when appropriate.<br> <br> The ILX is equipped with larger brakes: 12.3-inch ventilated brake rotors clamped by single-piston calipers in front; 11.1-inch diameter solid rotors clamped by single-piston calipers in the rear.<br> <br> The servo ratio is idealized for improved braking response with initial pedal force, while high-strength calipers add stiffness for improved pedal feel and braking effectiveness. The result is a secure, effective and confidence-inspiring braking system.<br> <br> <strong>Hill Start Assist</strong><br> <br> Standard on all 2016 ILX models is hill start assist. This feature holds brake pressure when stopped on an incline or descent for a brief period of time, allowing the driver\'s foot to move from the brake pedal to accelerator without the vehicle moving.<br> <br> <strong>Wheels and Tires</strong><br> <br> P215/45R17 all-season tires mounted on 17×7-inch 10-spoke painted aluminum wheels offer an excellent blend of ride quality, handling and fuel efficiency. Premium and Tech Plus models equipped with the new-for-2016 A-SPEC Package roll on lower-aspect-ratio P225/40R18 all-season tires wrapping 18x7.5-inch 10-spoke black-painted, machined-face aluminum wheels for enhanced handling and even crisper steering response.<br> <br> <strong>Space- and Weight-Saving Tire Repair Kit</strong><br> <br> The ILX uses a space- and weight-saving tire repair kit that is stored under the carpeted floor in the trunk.<br> <br> <strong>Tire-Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)</strong><br> <br> A standard Tire-Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) helps the driver maintain proper air pressure to improve driving safety and fuel efficiency, as well as reduce wear and tear on the vehicle\'s tires. A TPMS icon illuminates to alert the driver whenever any of the tires has a significantly low-pressure reading that requires the driver\'s attention. A color TPMS display in Premium and above grades, shows real-time pressure readouts for all four tires.<br> <br> <strong>Interior</strong><br> <br> The ILX sport sedan\'s updated content continues into the cabin for 2016 with key appearance upgrades and equipment additions. Offering a seamless combination of luxury, performance and technology, the ILX interior exhibits the high level of fit and finish expected of Acura, and puts it in reach of more buyers than ever before.<br> <br> Settle into the comfortable and supportive driver\'s seat, and the focus on driver control is unmistakable.

The capabilities of the full-color MID display expand to cover turn-by-turn navigation instructions, audio source, volume and track settings, hands-free phone information, and on models with Acura Watch, Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Keeping Assist System imagery. The MID is operated via controls positioned on the steering wheel that allow the driver to cycle the display through additional screens of information while keeping both hands on the wheel.<br> <br> The MID can display:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>Upcoming maintenance needs</li>     <li>TPMS tire-pressure warning</li>     <li>Average and instantaneous fuel economy</li>     <li>Fuel range</li>     <li>Average vehicle speed</li>     <li>Elapsed time</li> </ul> <br> The full-color MID adds:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>Turn-by-turn navigation instructions</li>     <li>Audio source, volume and track</li>     <li>Hands-free phone with number display</li>     <li>TPMS tire-pressure readouts for individual tires</li> </ul> <br> The full-color MID in models with AcuraWatch adds Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Keeping Assist System status<br> <br> <strong>Multi-View Rear Camera</strong><br> <br> When the standard ILX transmission is placed in Reverse, the view from a rear-mounted camera is displayed on the 5-inch color central display. When equipped with the Premium or Tech Plus Package using the rearward-view, images appear on the W-VGA 8-inch color monitor used for the navigation system.<br> <br> To make it easier for the driver to judge distance and clearance, solid yellow guidelines indicate the vehicle\'s width, as well as distances of 1, 2 and 3 meters (about 1, 2 and 3 yards) as measured from the rear of the ILX.<br> <br> The rearview camera has a multi-view display. The driver can select from top, normal and wide views. The primary view is \"Normal View,\" which delivers 130 degrees of rearward visibility. For special conditions, there is the \"Wide View,\" which delivers 175 degrees of rearward visibility. Finally, the \"Top View\" generates a bird\'s eye view of the parking area- helping the driver to maneuver in tight spaces.<br> <br> <strong>One-Touch Turn Signals</strong><br> <br> The ILX features a new one-touch turn signal system that makes lane changes more convenient. If the ILX driver moves the turn signal lever up (right turn) or down (left turn) for less than one second, the turn signals will flash three times and then self-cancel.<br> <br> <strong>Seating</strong><br> <br> Supportive seating is critical in a sport sedan, where aggressive driving can create high longitudinal and lateral loadings on interior occupants. During spirited acceleration, cornering and braking, secure seating for the driver and passengers is an important part of overall comfort and driver control. The ILX front seats are specifically designed to offer substantial lateral support, both in the lower back and shoulder areas. The ILX is equipped with an 8-way power adjustable driver\'s seat and heated front seats that can warm at two different levels. When an ILX is optioned with the Premium or Tech Plus package, a 4-way power adjustable passenger\'s seat and 2-position driver\'s seat memory are also included.<br> <br> The standard ILX seats have leatherette seating surfaces available in Premium Black, Sandstorm or new Jewel Gray color. The ILX Premium or Tech Plus Packages upgrade to perforated leather seating sections and synthetic leather side bolsters, also offered in Premium Black, Sandstorm or new Jewel Gray color. When Premium or Tech Plus is combined with the new A-SPEC package, the seats are trimmed in perforated black Lux Suede R with exclusive gray stitching.<br> <br> <strong>Interior Room</strong><br> <br> Though it has compact exterior dimensions, inside the ILX offers a surprisingly spacious 89.3 cubic-feet of passenger space. Efficient packaging offers comfortable long-haul space for four passengers and the ILX can accommodate five passengers for shorter drives. The nearly flat rear floor center-section affords good foot room for the center passenger.<br> <br> <strong>Cargo Carrying Versatility</strong><br> <br> The trunk cargo volume is 12.4 cubic feet, or 12.3 cubic feet with the Premium or Tech Plus Package. When more space is needed for cargo, the standard one-piece fold-down rear seatback can be lowered to reveal a pass-through to the back seat area.<br> <br> <strong>Comfort and Convenience Items</strong><br> <br> The ILX interior offers a range of useful features to enhance passenger comfort and convenience. A pair of console-mounted cupholders can accommodate large drinks, and the front door panels have bottle holders.

Built into the overhead module, HomeLink can be programmed with the remote-control codes of up to three devices, such as a garage-door opener, a remote lighting system, or a home security system.<br> <br> <strong>Power Windows with Auto-Up/Down</strong><br> <br> All ILX models have front and rear power windows with one-touch auto-up/down driver\'s and front passenger\'s windows also featuring auto-up/down capability. Illuminated controls allow for easy operation at night.<br> <br> <strong>Door Auto-Locking/Unlocking</strong><br> <br> The ILX features a programmable auto-locking/unlocking system that is preset to automatically lock the doors when the vehicle reaches approximately 10 mph. Drivers can program the system to lock and unlock doors in several different ways, or else deactivate some or all of the system if desired.<br> <br> <strong>Variable-Speed Windshield Wipers</strong><br> <br> All ILX models have variable-speed windshield wipers that automatically adjust the rate of operation according to vehicle speed. The result is the most efficient clearing of moisture from the windshield, and minimal wind noise at highway speeds. The design of the wipers also helps the blades press firmly against the windshield even at higher speeds, further assisting the clearing process.<br> <br> <strong>Auto On/Off Headlights</strong><br> <br> The ILX features auto-on/off headlights for greater convenience. A sensor atop the instrument panel detects ambient light levels and turns on the car\'s headlights and taillights at dusk, for night driving or when driving through a dimly lit areas such as a parking garage or tunnel.<br> <br> <strong>Dual-Zone Automatic Climate Control System</strong><br> <br> The ILX has as standard a dual-zone automatic climate control with clear, intuitive controls. A replaceable filter system helps remove particulates from the interior air. When operated in Auto mode, the system can automatically alter defrost airflow, based on temperature and humidity. When equipped with the Acura Navigation System with Voice Recognition™, key HVAC system functions can be accomplished via voice command. In addition, the navigation system calculates sun position to adjust system operation from side to side to help compensate for solar heating.<br> <br> <strong>Keyless Access System</strong><br> <br> The ILX receives as standard equipment the latest generation of Acura\'s Keyless Access System. The system lets the ILX owner gain access to the vehicle without having to unlock it with the remote transmitter or a conventional key. The Keyless Access Remote has a unique digital identity and the ILX can be unlocked when the driver pulls one of the front door handles while the remote in his/her possession. Once the driver has opened the door and is seated, the Keyless Access System allows the ILX to be started by depressing the brake pedal and then pushing the Engine Start/Stop button (it is unnecessary to insert and twist a traditional ignition key).<br> <br> When leaving the ILX, a press of the soft-touch button on the outside of the exterior door handle simultaneously locks all the doors. Alternatively, a press of the Lock button on the Keyless Access Remote will also lock all the doors. The Keyless Access System will not allow the transmitter fob to be locked in the interior of the ILX. When carrying the fob (or if all doors are unlocked), the trunk can be opened by pressing a button located on the ILX\'s rear fascia.<br> <br> The Keyless Access System also features a unique \"quick vent\" feature (activated by pressing the Keyless Access Remote \"unlock\" button two times and then holding it) that automatically lowers all side windows and opens the power moonroof to quickly vent built-up interior heat. In addition, turning the key in the driver\'s door key cylinder to the \"lock\" position twice (and then holding it the second time), simultaneously closes all open windows and the moonroof.<br> <br> When the remote battery is low, the ILX will signal the driver to bring the key fob closer to the Start Button for ignition, and the MID will display that the key fob battery is low. A mechanical key is built into the remote fob and provides a back up to enter the vehicle in the event that the Keyless Access Remote battery should fail.<br> <br> <strong>Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® Wireless Telephone Interface</strong><br> <br> All ILX models feature as standard the Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® hands-free telephone interface that is designed to work with most Bluetooth-enabled mobile telephones. Bluetooth is a radio frequency-based technology that lets portable devices (such as mobile telephones, PDAs and laptop computers) communicate wirelessly. The ILX system is compatible with Bluetooth-enabled cellular phones that have the Hands Free Profile (HFP); some early Bluetooth®-enabled phones do not have this communications protocol. After the driver completes a one-time pairing process, the ILX will communicate wirelessly with the driver\'s cellular telephone when it is within approximately 10 feet of the car. The phone needs to be on, but it can be stowed in a pocket, purse, briefcase or anywhere inside the ILX cabin.<br> <br> Bluetooth HandsFreeLink allows the driver to send or answer telephone calls without removing hands from the steering wheel. When a call comes in, the telephone number of the incoming caller is displayed on the center display and a telephone ring tone is played over the audio system. If the driver chooses to answer the call, a press of the \"Pick up\" button located on the steering wheel mutes the audio system and the incoming caller is heard over the audio system speakers. An overhead microphone picks up the driver\'s voice. Algorithms built into the Bluetooth HandsFreeLink system help cancel \"echo effect\" and reduce background noise to improve the transmission quality of the driver\'s speech.<br> <br> To make a call hands-free, the driver can dial the number by voice after using the fingertip controls on the steering wheel to activate the system. The driver also can store frequently called numbers with voice tags in the system\'s address book. Up to six different compatible mobile telephones can be paired with the Bluetooth HandsFreeLink system at one time. Additional information can be found at www.acura.com/handsfreelink.<br> <br> <strong>Audio System with CD and AM/FM Tuner</strong><br> <br> The ILX\'s standard audio system features six speakers and delivers a high-performance listening experience. Engineered for simple and intuitive operation, the audio system incorporates a single-disc CD player and an AM/FM tuner. Audio information is displayed on a 5-inch color LCD display, which is positioned at the top of the center stack. On all ILX models, the audio system also displays Radio Broadcast Data System (RBDS) information, which appears as text showing station name and program type.<br> <br> Located on the roof is a \"shark fin\" type antenna that is optimized to help deliver excellent radio reception without the negative impact on vehicle aerodynamics that would be caused by a traditional mast antenna. Remote controls located on the ILX\'s 3-spoke steering wheel put frequently used audio functions within fingertip reach of the driver.<br> <br> <strong>Connectivity</strong><br> <br> The sound system offers USB port connectivity for items such as an iPod®, iPhone® or removable USB flash-drive storage devices containing WMA, MP3 or AAC format music. The USB port is powered and can simultaneously charge plug-in devices while transferring information to the audio system. The USB-connected devices can be operated via the audio system\'s controls, with filenames and folders appearing on the central display. When an iPod is connected via the USB port, the album artwork can be displayed on the central display.<br> <br> The ILX audio system can play Bluetooth Audio when paired with a compatible device. Bluetooth Audio is a wireless transfer music format that is separate from Bluetooth HandsFreeLink used for telephone voice communication. Bluetooth Audio will display the song title and artist name (when using a compatible phone). There is also an auxiliary (AUX) jack connection enabling use of a portable MP3 music player. The AUX connection requires the music player to be controlled via the device\'s own interface, although the ILX audio system can control volume, or be used to select a different input, such as the radio, CD player or others.<br> <br> <strong>Pandora® Interface</strong><br> <br> The ILX features a Pandora® interface, allowing users to use the audio system to control the free music service on their smartphone, accessing up to 100 personalized internet \"radio stations\" they created on their computer based on favorite songs or artists. Although the Pandora service currently is free, phone data charges will apply.<br> <br> Starting with the Premium Package, an iPhone or compatible Android phone can be connected wirelessly, using Bluetooth HandsFreeLink (iPhone is also supported via the Pandora® Audio USB interface on all trims). To use Pandora, the Pandora app is launched on a compatible connected smartphone and the vehicle\'s audio source is set to Pandora. The audio/information screen (or navigation display in vehicles with navigation) and central color screen shows Pandora information and album art, and the audio controls allow listeners to choose from among existing stations, pause, resume, skip forward, and mark a track with \"Like\" or \"Dislike\" ratings. Some functionality of the Pandora app is locked out when using the ILX\'s Pandora interface.<br> <br> Pandora audio can also be streamed wirelessly to the ILX by a compatible cell phone via the Bluetooth HandsFreeLink connection. With this type of connection, however, Pandora must be controlled via the phone when the vehicle is stopped and it is safe to do so. Though the ILX volume control can be used to set the sound level, the other features of the Pandora interface are not available.<br> <br> <strong>SMS Text Messaging Function</strong><br> <br> All ILX models have as standard equipment an SMS text messaging feature that can read incoming texts aloud over the audio system. In addition, the driver can reply to the text with any of six factory preset messages. The system works with SMS-capable cellular telephones (such as the Blackberry, Droid X and others) that have an active data plan and the Message Access Profile (MAP). Currently, the iPhone5 and 6 support some of the MAP features (such as receiving texts) but not others (such as sending replies).<br> <br> Once a compatible cell phone is paired with the Bluetooth HandsFreeLink system, the text messaging function is enabled. When the phone receives a text message, an alert appears on the central display. Using the audio system controls, the driver can choose to have the message read aloud, can select among the preset reply choices (see below), or can call the sender- all without handling the mobile phone.<br> <br> To help avoid driver distraction, the text of the incoming message is not displayed on screen unless the transmission is in Park.<br> <br> Available factory preset text replies:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>Talk to you later, I\'m driving.</li>     <li>I\'m on my way.</li>     <li>I\'m running late.</li>     <li>OK</li>     <li>Yes</li>     <li>No</li> </ul> <br> <strong>Speed-Sensitive Volume Compensation</strong><br> <br> For optimum sound regardless of vehicle speed, all ILX modes include Speed-sensitive Volume Compensation (SVC). SVC adjusts audio volume based on vehicle speed to help compensate for continually increasing/decreasing external background sounds in the ILX. The result of SVC is transparent in operation and a more consistent perceived sound level is generated regardless of vehicle speed. SVC is standard with the audio systems on all ILX models.<br> <br> <strong>Wallpaper Image Display</strong><br> <br> To further customize the ILX interior, the navigation system allows the storage of 3 images that can be displayed on the LCD screen when the display is not otherwise in use. To avoid driver distraction, there is no \"slide show\" function.<br> <br> <strong>Premium Package Audio System</strong><br> <br> The ILX with Premium Package features an AM/FM/CD audio system with seven speakers, including a subwoofer. A pair of 2.5-cm tweeters are positioned in the top of the instrument panel, and two 17-cm drivers are positioned in the front doors. The rear doors have another pair of 17-cm drivers and a 20-cm subwoofer is located in the rear package tray.<br> <br> Audio information is presented in the On-Demand Multi-Use Display (ODMD) which consists of an upper 8-inch color display at the top of the center stack and a lower 7-inch touch screen. For 2016, the ODMD receives more than 50 design changes to enhance intuitive operation and functionality. As before, remote controls located on the ILX\'s 3-spoke steering wheel put frequently used audio functions within fingertip reach of the driver.<br> <br> New for 2016 is a tethered navigation system powered by the user\'s compatible smartphone and data plan. The system connects to the smartphone via an HDMI port located inside the center console. Once tethered, the operator can zoom in, zoom out and scroll the car\'s navigation map using the large controller dial beneath the lower touchscreen. Destination searches can be accomplished via text inputted onto the ODMD touchscreen keyboard.<br> <br> Also included with the Premium Package audio system are SiriusXM® Satellite Radio, Aha™ compatibility and HD Radio™.<br> <br> <strong>SiriusXM® Radio</strong><br> <br> SiriusXM® Radio is a standard feature with the ILX Premium and Tech Plus audio systems and it provides more than 165 channels of digital programming with near CD-quality sound. The SiriusXM signal is beamed from two broadcast satellites positioned in geostationary orbit above Earth. The beams from these two broadcast satellites combine to span the entire continental United States and some of Canada. SiriusXM Radio programming includes channels specifically devoted to music, sports, talk, traffic, weather, children\'s programming and entertainment. Of the more than 165 SiriusXM channels, 72 are commercial-free. When the ILX audio system plays SiriusXM Radio, the display screen shows the current station, song title, or artist\'s name. A complimentary 3-month subscription to SiriusXM Radio service is included with purchase of a new ILX, and customers are able to continue the service or cancel any time afterwards.<br> <br> <strong>HD Radio™</strong><br> <br> Premium and Tech Plus ILX models feature HD Radio™. HD Radio technology utilizes digital radio broadcasts and provides advanced audio and data features that enhance the listening experience. Sound quality is radically improved, and unlike satellite radio, HD Radio is free.<br> <br> Instead of sending out one analog signal as with traditional radio broadcasts, HD stations send out a bundled signal - both analog and digital. Because it is digital, textual data such as traffic, stock info and song titles can be sent out, as well. Unlike conventional radio, HD Radio stations broadcast extra channels, which are called HD2/HD3. These added channels offer ILX owners a universe of additional choices.<br> <br> <strong>Aha™ by Harman</strong><br> <br> The audio system in ILXs equipped with the Premium or Tech Plus Package also feature Aha™ by Harman This voice-based capability can be accessed using a compatible smartphone.

The ELS® system, developed together with Panasonic Automotive Systems, uses 10 speakers and a powerful amplifier to create a unique listening experience in the ILX. The Acura/ELS Studio Premium Audio System gets its name from multi-Grammy® Award winning producer/engineer Elliot Scheiner\'s recording industry-recognized moniker \"ELS®.\" Scheiner\'s goal in the development of this audio system was to reproduce music the way it is heard in the recording studio.<br> <br> As with the 7-speaker Premium audio system, the Acura/ELS Studio Premium Audio system can play program material from a wide range of sources. The CD player can read discs encoded with MP3 or WMA files. There\'s a 2.5 mm auxiliary jack for use with an external MP3 player, and a USB port is located in the center console for the connection of an iPod® or compatible MP3 player. When used with compatible iPod models, the USB connection provides iPod control via the audio head unit. Bluetooth Audio allows a compatible cellular telephone with a built-in audio player to wirelessly play the phone\'s audio content on the ILX audio system.<br> <br> The Acura/ELS Studio audio system features selectable Dolby® Pro Logic® II signal processing that creates simulated 5.1-channel surround sound from CD, MP3/WMA, SiriusXM Radio, AUX and USB inputs. The ILX audio system plays conventional CDs and DTS™ discs, in addition to DVD-Audio discs. The system also includes SiriusXM Radio, along with the Note function for SiriusXM Radio which is designed to be a convenience for owners who want to make note of songs heard on SiriusXM.<br> <br> While Scheiner and Panasonic tuned the Acura/ELS Studio Premium Audio system to create outstanding sound from any source, DVD-Audio is the system\'s most impressive sounding format. This advanced audio reproduction technology delivers over 500-times higher resolution than traditional CD audio. DVD-Audio delivers smoother, fuller and far more accurate sound through six discrete channels.<br> <br> With this system, the center instrument stack features Acura\'s On-Demand Multi-Use Display (ODMD) with an upper 8-inch W-VGA full-color display screen that displays navigation, audio, backup camera and other information and a lower 7-inch touchscreen display that provides climate control, clock and audio information. To make Acura/ELS Studio system simple to operate, it has large-format dash-mounted controls. In addition, steering wheel-mounted controls of key audio functions are positioned within fingertip reach. Select audio system functions can also be executed via voice commands.<br> <br> The AM/FM tuner gets signals from a roof-mounted \"shark fin\" type antenna. The system displays Radio Data System (RDS) information, which can show items such as station name and program type.<br> <br> <strong>10-Speaker Array</strong><br> <br> Each of the 10 speakers in the Acura/ELS Studio® Premium Audio system uses a high-energy Neodymium magnet for excellent sound quality and to reduce weight. There are 2.5-cm soft-dome tweeters in the front A-pillar location, plus an 8-cm midrange polypropylene-cone center speaker in the middle of the dashboard top. Each of the doors has a 17-cm full-range dual-thickness polypropylene-cone speaker, and in the rear parcel shelf there are two 8-cm drivers flanking a special Super Low Distortion 20-cm subwoofer. The combination of high performance speaker drivers, optimal speaker locations and high power creates an audio system that delivers outstanding sound at any seating position.<br> <br> <strong>Song By Voice®</strong><br> <br> Due to so much potential audio content available in a user\'s iPod, Acura engineers set out to make it easy to choose audio content while driving. Song By Voice® (SBV) lets the driver choose music by artist, album, song title, genre, playlist and even composer.<br> <br> <strong>Siri™ Eyes Free</strong><br> <br> Siri™ Eyes Free is included with the ILX Premium and above grades. When the ILX\'s Bluetooth HandsFreeLink system is paired with a compatible iPhone, Siri Eyes Free allows you to use many of the features of Siri without removing your hands from the steering wheel. A push of approximately two seconds on the steering wheel-mounted \"talk\" button activates Siri in the ILX. After the Siri chime sounds, the driver can ask a question, set up a calendar entry and more. Siri offers a wide range of capabilities including sending and reading aloud text and email messages, setting alarms and reminders, checking the weather, posting to social media sites and much more. Siri can also find a point of interest and then provide turn-by-turn audio directions when the audio system is set to Bluetooth audio or iPod mode. The system switches automatically to Bluetooth audio when playing a song or artist.<br> <br> <strong>Acura Navigation System with Voice Recognition™</strong><br> <br> All ILX models with the Tech Plus Package are equipped with the Acura Navigation System with Voice Recognition™ that is designed for intuitive and quick operation.<br> <br> <strong>Destinations Searchable by GPS Coordinates</strong><br> <br> The Acura Navigation System with Voice Recognition™ tracks the position of the ILX based on positioning data from up to 12 orbiting Global Positioning Satellites (GPS). If GPS reception is blocked by a tall building, tunnel or parking garage, an internal gyroscopic system with a speed sensor tracks the location to keep the mapping information current and reliable until satellite reception is restored. The ILX navigation system stores its mapping data on a large internal hard disk drive (HDD). The same drive is partitioned and used by the Tech Plus Acura/ELS Studio Premium audio system to store audio files. Much faster than a DVD drive system, the HDD is the key to the system\'s impressive search and routing speed. The system can be updated annually with the latest mapping information by inserting an update disc into the audio system\'s slot-loading CD/DVD drive. DVD update discs are available for purchase on an annual basis on-line at www.acura.com or by calling 888-549-3798.<br> <br> The navigation system can be controlled by using the interface dial by choosing menu options or by spelling out a word (e.g., an address, business name or place). Characters on an on-screen keypad can be selected using the Interface Dial. For voice operation, the driver simply presses the \"Talk\" button on the steering wheel and says any of a number of preset command phrases. The system responds to more than 1,100 command phrases, as well as to spoken city and street names. Voice recognition capability saves time and simplifies operation of the system.<br> <br> The audio system is automatically muted when the \"Talk\" button is pressed, and an overhead array microphone receives the command from the driver. Commands can be given in plain English, like \"Display gas stations,\" \"Find nearest hospital,\" or \"Find nearest Chinese restaurant.\" The voice recognition technology allows the driver to simply speak city and street names aloud, and the system responds by displaying matches available in the database. Points of interest on the map (such as restaurants or grocery stores) can be displayed or you can have the system provide turn-by-turn navigation- all by voice command. The massive point-of-interest (POI) database includes telephone numbers, which can be dialed by using the Bluetooth HandsFreeLink system or with the driver\'s cellular telephone.<br> <br> <strong>Wallpaper Image Display</strong><br> <br> To further customize the ILX interior, the navigation system allows the storage of up to 10 images on the built-in hard disk drive (HDD) media storage. Any one of the stored images can be displayed as a full-screen image on the navigation display when the display is not otherwise in use. To avoid driver distraction, there is no \"slide show\" function.<br> <br> JPEG images can be loaded from a home computer onto a USB storage device, such as a thumb drive. Then the thumb drive can be plugged into the USB port that located in the center console. Using on-screen menus, the images can then be transferred to the ILX internal hard disk drive (HDD) media storage. The driver can then choose among their stored images for display, or set the system to not display wallpaper.<br> <br> <strong>AcuraLink®</strong><br> <br> The ILX with the Tech Plus Package features the next generation of AcuraLink®, Acura\'s cloud-based connected car system that first launched in 2005. This new generation uses embedded cellular technology along with the owner\'s compatible smartphone and data package to offer a broad range of convenience, media and available security features. AcuraLink is the new center point for owners for hands-free access to cloud-based services, audio and information, and is designed to keep ILX drivers informed and connected while on the go.<br> <br> The connectivity required for AcuraLink\'s various features is distributed between the ILX\'s embedded system (for some of the fee-based features) and the owner\'s compatible smartphone and data package (for free features). AcuraLink works with the owner\'s compatible smartphone and data package to connect the ILX with music and information resources, internet apps, and more. Owners can use the AcuraLink website to access information or change preferences. AcuraLink allows for Twitter and Facebook access.<br> <br> <strong>Active Noise Control</strong><br> <br> The ILX features an Active Noise Control system that not only helps eliminate low-decibel booming noise entering the cabin. In addition, Active Noise Control is linked to throttle position and engine rpm to provide a quieter cockpit during normal cruising while allowing the engine\'s sound to be enjoyed during higher rpm, more spirited driving.<br> <br> The Active Noise Control system operates whenever the car is running, regardless of whether the audio system is on or off. Interior microphones capture low-end drivetrain frequencies entering the cabin, and send a signal to the Active Noise Control unit. The Active Noise Control unit then creates a precisely timed reverse phase audio signal that is sent to an amplifier, which powers the door speakers.<br> <br> The Active Noise Control dramatically reduces the booming noise of the exhaust. At frequencies below 100 hertz, Active Noise Control results in an impressive 10 dB reduction in noise level. Moreover, the Active Noise Control system dramatically reduces middle-frequency noise during normal cruising. In addition, road noise attenuation is also improved over both smooth and rough roads.<br> <br> <strong>Safety and Driver-Assistive Technology</strong><br> <br> Safety has been a core element of Acura\'s commitment to excellence since the brand was founded nearly three decades ago. With the launch of the 2016 ILX, the division continues to advance safety performance for not only the driver and passenger, but for occupants of other vehicles and for pedestrians as well. While ongoing efforts to improve safety include designs and technologies to improve performance in a collision, they also include innovations that help Acura drivers avoid collisions altogether.<br> <br> <strong>New Driver-Assistive Technology for 2016</strong><br> <br> The newest of these measures form the basis of AcuraWatch™, the most advanced array of safety and driver-assistive technologies in the class. The ILX AcuraWatch suite includes Adaptive Cruise Control, Lane Keeping Assist System, Road Departure Mitigation and the Collision Mitigation Braking System™ with pedestrian-sensing capability. Additionally, Forward Collision Warning (part of the Collision Mitigating Braking System) and Lane Departure Warning (part of Road Departure Mitigation) round out the comprehensive lineup of AcuraWatch safety technologies.<br> <br> For 2016, AcuraWatch is included along with a comprehensive list of standard items with the Tech Plus Package. It is also available in a package on the base ILX. The AcuraWatch suite of safety and driver-assistive technologies employ a windshield-mounted monocular camera to identify objects and/or a grille-mounted millimeter-wave radar unit to determine their relative position and speed. The common thread of these safety technologies is to provide driver assistance by initiating alerts and, where necessary, applying various levels of corrective input to the throttle, steering or brakes to avoid a collision or mitigate its severity.<br> <br> Also new for 2016 is the blind spot information system and the Cross Traffic Monitor feature. Both of these systems use a pair of radar sensors at the ends of the rear bumper to detect the position and movement of objects behind the vehicle and to provide the driver with visual and audible alerts if any are detected in close proximity. Blind spot information and Cross Traffic Monitor are included with the Premium and Tech Plus Packages.<br> <br> In addition to the new AcuraWatch suite of technologies, plus the Rear Cross Traffic Monitor and the blind spot information system, the 2016 Acura ILX employs a comprehensive group of active safety technologies as standard equipment. These include the latest generation of Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) with a Motion Adaptive Electric Power Steering system, surefooted braking from a 4-wheel-disc-brake Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) with Brake Assist, and precise handling from its 4-wheel independent suspension.<br> <br> The 2016 ILX incorporates numerous passive safety technologies as standard equipment, including side-curtain airbags, dual-stage, multiple-threshold front airbags (SRS), front seat SmartVent side airbags and a front seat design that can help reduce the severity of neck injury in the event of a rear collision. A Next-Generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure helps make the ILX highly effective at absorbing and distributing the energy of a frontal collision.<br> <br> Additional standard safety features include front seatbelts with automatic tensioning system and load limiters, and a pedestrian injury mitigation design in the front of the vehicle. Driver- and front-passenger seatbelt reminders and daytime running lights (DRL) are also standard equipment. A Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH) child seat mounting system is standard for all ILX models. The lower anchors are positioned on the two outboard rear seat locations and the top tether is positioned on the top of the center seating position (near the rear package tray location).<br> <br> <strong>Next-Generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ Body Structure</strong><br> <br> Incorporating Acura\'s Next-Generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure technology, the ILX enhances occupant protection and crash compatibility in frontal collisions. The next-generation ACE design utilizes a network of connected structural elements to help distribute crash energy more evenly throughout the front of the vehicle. This enhanced frontal crash energy management helps to reduce the forces transferred to the passenger compartment and can help to more evenly disperse the forces transferred to other vehicles in a crash. Additionally, Next-Generation ACE helps minimize the potential for under-ride or over-ride situations that can happen during head-on or offset frontal impacts with a significantly larger or smaller vehicle.<br> <br> Unlike most conventional designs that direct frontal crash energy only to the lower load-bearing structures in the front end, Next-Generation ACE actively channels frontal crash energy to both upper and lower structural elements-including the floor frame rails, side sills and A-pillars. By creating specifically engineered \"pathways\" that help distribute these frontal impact forces through a greater percentage of the vehicle\'s total structure, the Next-Generation ACE system can more effectively route them around and away from the passenger compartment to help limit cabin deformation and further improve occupant protection. Integral to the Next-Generation ACE design is its unique front polygonal main design structure.<br> <br> <strong>2016 Next-Generation ACE Body Structure Enhancements</strong><br> <br> For the 2016 model year, the ILX body structure is enhanced to improve performance in small-offset frontal collisions. The main areas of reinforcement are:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>Front wheelhouse upper member</li>     <li>Front pillar</li>     <li>Side sill</li>     <li>Front floor frame</li> </ul> <br> <strong>Collision Safety Targets</strong><br> <br> The 2016 ILX is designed to more efficiently absorb and dispense the energy in a frontal collision and targets a 5-Star Overall Vehicle Score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and a TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating from the Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), including a targeted GOOD rating in the IIHS\' small-overlap frontal crash test.<br> <br> <strong>AcuraWatch™</strong><br> <br> New for 2016, the ILX can be equipped with a host of AcuraWatch driver-assistive technologies that help to improve the driver\'s situational awareness and, in certain circumstances, intervene to help avoid a collision or mitigate its severity. These include:<br> <br> <strong>Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC)</strong><br> <br> Included in the ILX\'s Tech Plus Package as well as standard models with the AcuraWatch™ Package, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) allows the driver to set a desired speed and following distance interval behind a vehicle detected ahead, allowing the use of cruise control in light traffic conditions. This significantly reduces driver stress in traffic. The system uses the Millimeter Wave Radar and a Monocular Camera to continually track the distance to the vehicle detected ahead, and then adjusts the car\'s speed to maintain a safe distance interval. A short, medium, long, or extra-long interval can be selected.<br> <br> <strong>Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS)</strong><br> <br> Included in the ILX with Tech Plus Package or Base models equipped with AcuraWatch, Acura\'s newest version of its Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) is one of the most sophisticated driver-assistive technologies available. It continually scans traffic conditions ahead of the ILX, alerts the driver when it determines there is the potential for a collision, and then takes emergency autonomous braking action to help reduce the severity of a collision if the driver fails to initiate corrective action.<br> <br> When CMBS detects a potential collision, visual and audible alerts prompt the driver to take corrective actions. The visual alerts appear on the Multi-Information Display (MID). If the system determines that a collision is imminent, full braking force is applied to help reduce vehicle speed and potential collision forces.<br> <br> Further distinguishing the 2016 ILX, its CMBS also recognizes shapes, and can differentiate between a vehicle and a pedestrian, warning the driver in each case. A Millimeter Wave Radar unit located behind the front grille and a monocular camera mounted at the upper portion of the windshield are used to detect vehicles, pedestrians and other objects. The radar unit and camera work simultaneously and cooperatively to control the VSA modulator, which provides any required braking. This \"sensor fusion\" of radar and camera allows the system to more quickly determine a potential collision, significantly increasing the likelihood of slowing the car and avoiding impact.<br> <br> It is important to note that CMBS cannot detect all objects ahead, nor is it intended to replace the driver\'s assessment of traffic conditions and control of the vehicle. The driver must intervene in certain situations, and must always be attentive when using the system. Although in certain cases CMBS can stop the car, it is not designed to prevent collisions. Based on the conditions, the system also may not perform all visual-, audible- and tactile-alert stages, and may instead automatically engage the brakes if the system deems it necessary.<br> <br> <strong>Forward Collision Warning (FCW)</strong><br> <br> Forward Collision Warning (FCW) uses a camera mounted in the upper portion of the windshield to detect vehicles and pedestrians ahead and to determine whether a collision is imminent. If the FCW system detects a vehicle or pedestrian in front of the ILX and then determines that a collision may occur (due to a speed differential between the ILX and the object), it will trigger a \"BRAKE\" message on the Multi-Information Display (MID) and an audible alert. The FCW system will not automatically brake, and the driver remains responsible for safely operating the vehicle and avoiding collisions.<br> <br> Drivers may adjust the distance at which FCW alerts occur and may choose between \"Long,\" \"Normal,\" or \"Short.\" Drivers may also select \"Off\" to disable the FCW system entirely.<br> <br> Note that the FCW system cannot detect all objects ahead; accuracy will vary based on weather conditions, speed and other factors. In addition, there are certain conditions under which the system may not engage or operate, including inclement weather (e.g., snow, ice or heavy rain) and extreme cabin heat conditions (due to operability of the camera).<br> <br> <strong>Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS)</strong><br> <br> Included in Tech Plus Package and Base models equipped with AcuraWatch, the Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) provides a less stressful driving experience by reducing steering correction movements and driving effort on the highway. LKAS uses a camera to read and detect lane markings and uses EPS to assist the driver in keeping in the middle of the lane.<br> <br> Designed for the U.S. road structure, the system uses a monocular camera mounted on the upper portion of the windshield to identify painted lanes, Botts\' Dots and Cat Eye markers at speeds between approximately 45 mph and 90 mph. When LKAS senses that the driver is drifting from the middle of a detected lane, the system generates corrective steering torque to assist the driver in maintaining lane position.<br> <br> <strong>Lane Departure Warning (LDW)</strong><br> <br> Lane Departure Warning (LDW) is designed to alert the driver if the vehicle is leaving a detected lane without a turn signal having been activated. The system functions at speeds from 45 to 90 mph on straight or slightly curved roads, alerting the driver of deviations from a detected lane.<br> <br> If the vehicle begins to move out of a detected lane without the turn signal activated, LDW illuminates a Lane Departure message on the Multi-Information Display (MID) and sounds an audible warning, advising the driver to take appropriate action. The system can be activated and deactivated by pressing the LDW button located on the instrument panel, to the left of the steering column.<br> <br> There are certain conditions under which the system may not engage or operate, including inclement weather (e.g., snow, ice or heavy rain) and extreme cabin heat conditions (due to operability of the camera). It will automatically suspend operation when the brakes are applied or a turn signal is used. LDW may not detect all lane markings or lane departures; accuracy will vary based on weather, speed and road condition. The driver remains responsible for safely operating the vehicle.<br> <br> <strong>Road Departure Mitigation (RDM)</strong><br> <br> Included in the Tech Plus Package and Base models equipped with AcuraWatch, Road Departure Mitigation (RDM) uses a monocular camera (mounted on the upper portion of the windshield) to identify solid or dashed painted lane lines, Botts\' dots and Cat Eye markers. RDM uses both steering force, via EPS, and braking force, via VSA, to help the ILX stay on the roadway or a solid-marked lane.<br> <br> The monocular camera recognizes lane features and identifies the lane. If the RDM system detects that the ILX is about to leave the detected lane or roadway, it will provide steering assist (primary) and, in certain circumstances such as crossing over a solid lane line, braking assist to prevent the vehicle from leaving the road. Only lane departure is activated if the driver is passing over a dashed line, Botts\' dots, buttons or Cat Eye markers, while deceleration support is disabled. In this case, the ILX uses active steering force to return to the lane. RDM is integrated with the Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) system to provide moderate braking, and with the Electric Power Steering (EPS) system to provide steering input.<br> <br> Multiple visual and tactile warnings alert the driver when the RDM system is taking corrective action. These include a lane departure warning on the driver\'s Multi Information Display (MID).<br> <br> RDM also has a customizable initial warning of either a steering wheel shake/vibration, or an audible alert. When the audible alert is selected, RDM does not take corrective steering action. This can be customized in the vehicle settings.<br> <br> <strong>Other Advanced Technologies</strong><br> <br> Additional technologies in the 2016 ILX assist the driver when backing up or with objects approaching from the rear.<br> <br> A multi-view rear camera that provides a choice of normal, wide angle and top-down images is standard on all ILX models. The camera image is displayed in the 5-inch (based models) or 8-inch (Premium and Tech Plus models) color TFT screen in the instrument panel center stack.<br> <br> Included on models with the Premium and Tech Plus packages are the blind spot information system and the Cross Traffic Monitor.<br> <br> <strong>Blind Spot Information (BSI)</strong><br> <br> The blind spot information (BSI) system uses two radar sensors to continually monitor conditions behind the ILX and alert the driver if another vehicle is detected in close proximity - especially a car that is approaching from the rear and blocked from the driver\'s peripheral view. The BSI system uses LED indicators on the A-pillars and an audible warning to alert the driver.<br> <br> There are two warning levels: 1) If a vehicle is detected in the driver\'s blind spot, the LED indicator on the incoming side illuminates; and 2) If a vehicle is detected and the ILX turn signal is activated, the LED indicator on the incoming side blinks and a buzzer sounds three times.<br> <br> To prevent false alarms while maneuvering at low speed, the BSI system is disabled below speeds of approximately 20 mph.<br> <br> <strong>Cross Traffic Monitor</strong><br> <br> The Cross Traffic Monitor works in conjunction with the ILX\'s BSI radar sensors to enhance driver confidence when backing up. The system is especially useful when reversing in congested parking lots with an obstructed view from driver\'s seat.<br> <br> The system utilizes a pair of BSI radar sensors located in the rear bumper corners. When Reverse is selected and an approaching vehicle is detected, arrows indicating the approaching vehicles direction are shown on the 8-inch center display\'s rear camera image. Simultaneously, an audible warning is initiated when vehicles are detected approaching from the side.<br> <br> <strong>Pedestrian Injury Mitigation Design</strong><br> <br> Structures in the front of the ILX are designed to help absorb energy in the event of a collision with a pedestrian. By maintaining a sufficient clearance between the hood and hard engine parts, the hood is able to deform if contact is made with a pedestrian. Additional features include energy-absorbing fender brackets and deformable hood hinges.<br> <br> <strong>Advanced Vehicle Stability Assist™ with Traction Control</strong><br> <br> The ILX has as standard equipment Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) which is an electronic stability control system that works in conjunction with the vehicle\'s Drive-By-Wire™ throttle and 4-channel anti-lock brakes (ABS) to enhance control while the vehicle is accelerating, braking or cornering, or when the driver makes an emergency avoidance maneuver. VSA functions by applying brake force to one or more wheels while simultaneously managing the throttle, ignition and fuel systems to control engine power with the goal of helping the vehicle maintain the driver\'s intended path of travel.<br> <br> The VSA system constantly analyzes data from six sensors that monitor wheel speed and vehicle speed, steering input, lateral G forces and yaw rate. VSA compares the driver\'s inputs with the vehicle\'s actual response. When the actual response falls outside of a predetermined acceptable range, VSA intervenes with a corrective action. For example, if VSA detects an oversteer condition, the system may apply braking force to the outside front and rear wheels to counteract the unintended yaw moment. In the event of understeer, VSA may apply braking to the inside rear wheel while reducing engine power to help return the car to its intended course.<br> <br> VSA also provides a limited-slip differential effect for the front wheels by applying braking force to a slipping wheel, thereby redirecting driving force to the wheel with more traction. VSA is calibrated to function in a nearly transparent manner, and in many cases a driver will not be aware of its operation. However, any time that the system is enhancing vehicle stability, an indicator light flashes in the instrument cluster. While the driver can deactivate the VSA stability enhancement and traction-control functions via a switch located on the instrument panel, ABS remains fully operational at all times.<br> <br> A new and additional type of control algorithm in the VSA system enables more responsive handling under icy or slippery conditions. The concept for this additional algorithm is based on patented knowledge gained from humanoid robotics research and development work.<br> <br> The conventional VSA feedback loop, which operates by comparing the actual vehicle course with the intended course, based on an ideal vehicle response, is augmented by additional control applied via a secondary feedback loop. This additional feedback loop is a type of filter that, in effect, quickens the estimation of the intended path (based on the driver\'s inputs) and acts in parallel to the conventional \"actual versus intended course\" stability control, and is used to augment that control.<br> <br> Like conventional VSA, the additional control loop also considers steering wheel angle, vehicle yaw rate, wheel speeds, throttle pedal position, vehicle acceleration and other variables. VSA then lightly brakes individual wheels as needed to predicatively direct the vehicle along its intended path, and is able to induce more yaw more quickly than conventional VSA on low friction roads. This advanced VSA system control loop results in faster reacting stability control and reduced transient understeer, which may occur on icy or other slippery roads. This makes the vehicle more responsive, improving path accuracy, and enhancing the fun-to-drive character that is a trademark of Acura vehicles.<br> <br> <strong>Brake Assist</strong><br> <br> A function of the VSA system, the Brake Assist feature recognizes emergency braking situations and almost instantly helps the driver apply full braking force. This Brake Assist feature is controlled by special logic that evaluates the pedal application rate and force to recognize a panic stop situation and apply maximum braking force, an action that can significantly shorten braking distances and help avoid or mitigate the severity of a collision.<br> <br> <strong>Advanced 4-Channel ABS with Electronic Brake Distribution</strong><br> <br> All models of the ILX are fitted with 4-wheel disc brakes with vented front rotors and solid rear rotors. The ABS system also incorporates Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) circuitry that automatically proportions brake force based on the vehicle\'s weight distribution.<br> <br> <strong>Dual-Stage Multiple-Threshold Front Airbags</strong><br> <br> Both the driver and front passenger seating positions have advanced front airbags (SRS) that incorporate dual-stage, multiple-threshold activation technology. One or both of these airbags will be deployed only in the event of a sufficiently severe frontal impact. If deployed, these airbags are capable of being inflated at different rates depending on crash severity, seatbelt usage and other factors. Like all Acura vehicles, the driver\'s front airbag is located in the steering wheel while the passenger airbag is located in the upper portion of the dashboard.<br> <br> <strong>Driver and Front Passenger Side Airbags</strong><br> <br> Driver and front passenger SmartVent® side airbags mounted in the outboard area of each front seatback are designed to help provide pelvis and thorax protection in the event of a severe side impact and also allows side airbags to inflate with low risk of injuring an out of position occupant. This eliminates the need for Occupant Position Detection System (OPDS).<br> <br> <strong>Side Curtain Airbags with Rollover Sensor</strong><br> <br> The ILX includes as standard equipment a side curtain airbag system that provides protection for all outboard seating positions. The side curtain airbags deploy from modules in each roof rail in the event of a sufficient side impact, providing a significant level of head protection in the window area. The side curtain airbags have a wider deployment profile and, if a rollover is detected, remain fully deployed for an extended time to further mitigate the possibility of an occupant being ejected from the vehicle.<br> <br> <strong>Seat Belts</strong><br> <br> Three-point seatbelts are standard for all seating positions. The front seat belts are equipped with automatic tensioners and load limiters to help minimize injury potential in a frontal collision. When an impact occurs, the automatic tensioner tightens the seat belt (shoulder and lap) to help hold the seat occupant firmly in position. Each front seat belt retractor incorporates a load limiter that works in conjunction with the automatic tensioner. The load limiter functions by permitting a small amount of controlled seat belt slack shortly after the automatic tensioner is activated to limit the peak restraining forces, thus reducing the potential of serious injury. The front seat belts also feature adjustable height shoulder anchors. To help increase seat-belt usage, a reminder for the driver and front passenger has been incorporated into the instrument cluster. After starting the vehicle, a weight sensor detects whether the front passenger seat is occupied. If the driver or front passenger has not already fastened the seat belt, an icon in the cluster illuminates and a chime sounds as a reminder to do so.<br> <br> <strong>Whiplash-Mitigation Front Seat Design</strong><br> <br> The driver and front passenger seats are designed to help mitigate the severity of neck injuries in the event of a rear impact. A wide spring range is incorporated in the seatback and bottom cushions.<br> <br> <strong>Adjustable Head Restraints for All Seating Positions</strong><br> <br> The front and rear seats feature individually adjustable head restraints for all passenger seating positions. All rear head restraints comply with the latest Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). The rules closely specify the size, position and operation of the rear-seat head restraints.<br> <br> <strong>Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH)</strong><br> <br> Lower Anchors and Tethers for Children (LATCH) provide a simple and convenient method to install compatible child safety seats in a vehicle. In all models of the ILX, the rear outboard seating positions are fitted with dedicated LATCH attachment points. The LATCH system features built-in, ready-to-use anchors allowing compatible child safety seats to be installed without using the vehicle\'s seat belt system. In addition, the rear center seating position features a tether anchor (located at the top of the seat near the rear package tray) that can be used to secure a single child safety seat. The ability to choose which location works best for individual needs can help families more conveniently maximize interior space.<br> <br> <strong>Tire-Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)</strong><br> <br> The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) alerts the driver whenever the air pressure in one or more of the vehicle\'s tires decrease significantly below the recommended level. The system has been updated for 2016 to show the air pressure of each individual tire. Using four sensors (one on each wheel), TPMS monitors and transmits information on tire air pressure to the ECU. When the pressure in one or more tires drops to a potentially critical level, it causes a low tire-pressure indicator (located in the multi-information display between the speedometer and tachometer) to illuminate.','[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_12.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_13.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_14.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_15.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_16.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_17.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_18.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_19.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_20.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_21.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_22.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_23.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_24.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_25.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_26.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_27.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_28.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_29.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_30.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_31.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_32.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_33.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_34.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_35.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_36.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_37.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_38.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_39.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_40.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_41.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_42.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_43.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_44.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_45.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_46.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_47.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_48.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_49.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_50.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_51.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_52.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_53.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_54.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_4.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_5.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_6.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_7.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_8.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_9.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_10.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ILX-5752_11.jpg\"]','2024-10-23 05:32:32','2024-10-23 05:32:32'),(21,'827dc295','https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/acura-rdx-2015.html',2,'ACURA RDX 2015-2018 Photos, engines &amp; full specs ','<p><strong>Launched at the 2015 Chicago Auto Show, the facelift for the second generation of the Acura RDX impressed due to its high luxury interior and important safety features.</strong></p><p></p><p>Acura introduced the first generation of the compact-size SUV RDX in 2006. It was based on the proven platform of the Honda CR-V and it kept it that way to the second generation as well. Its qualities were from the start of a comprehensive package that included safety and comfort features. The second generation came in 2012 and switched from the 2.3-liter turbocharged engines to the smoother 3.5-liter V6, which kept it for all trim levels.</p><p>The changes applied in 2015 were big, especially for the look. It featured a new front fascia with standard LED headlights and a new bumper. The grille was modified according to a new 3D concept. In the rear, a new set of taillights and a new bumper improved the look from behind.</p><p>Inside, the driver received a 4.2” TFT display in the instrument cluster. The top trim level, named Advance, received the AcuraWatch safety package as standard, while it was available as an option on the other versions. It included Lane Keep Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control, Collision Mitigation Braking System, and multi-view rear camera with cross-traffic alert.</p><p>The engine was revamped and received 6 additional horsepower when compared to the non-facelifted version, reaching to 279hp. More important was the better fuel-efficiency achieved by the 2016 version, due to the new Variable Cylinder Management system, which shuts of cylinders on steady driving situations. The RDX featured a standard 6-speed automatic transmission and front-wheel-drive, while the all-wheel-drive system was included in the options list.</p>','<strong>Coming off its best-ever year, the newly refreshed and energized 2016 Acura RDX luxury sport-utility made its world debut at the 2015 Chicago Auto Show, sporting a host of significant upgrades to performance, luxury prestige and styling. Launching at Acura dealerships nationwide this Spring, the 2016 Acura RDX receives Jewel Eye™ LED projector headlamps and LED taillights, a new, more powerful 3.5-liter i-VTEC® V-6 engine, an expanded list of AcuraWatch™ safety and driver-assistive technologies, and a host of new luxury features and technologies, including a new line-topping RDX with Advance Package.</strong><br> <br> The Acura RDX and MDX have formed a potent 1-2 punch in the luxury SUV game, posting record sales in 2014 well ahead of European rivals in their segments. With the 2016 MDX also getting significant new features and technologies, including a 9-speed automatic transmission, the new RDX and MDX stand as an even more formidable presence in the luxury SUV space.<br> <br> \"The RDX ended on a high note in 2014, posting its best sales year ever, but at Acura, we are not content in resting on our laurels,\" said Mike Accavitti, senior vice president and general manager of Acura. \"The 2016 RDX gets a major infusion of Acura brand DNA including enhancements to styling, driving performance, and exciting new luxury feature-content, further solidifying its place as the one to beat in the entry luxury SUV segment.\"<br> <br> The 2016 RDX gets an important performance boost courtesy of its new 3.5-liter SOHC i-VTEC V-6 engine with Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) cylinder deactivation technology. Peak horsepower and torque output are up - 279 (+6 hp) and 252 lb.-ft. (+1 lb.-ft.), respectively, while sporting a broader torque curve for more immediate and powerful acceleration response - right where it counts. Variable Cylinder Management™ allows for deactivation of two of the engine\'s six cylinders under light engine loads, helping the more powerful 2016 RDX increase its highway EPA fuel-economy ratings by 1 mpg, rising to 19/28mpg for AWD models and 20/29mpg for FWD models (city/highway). Driving refinement is further enhanced by new active front and rear engine mounts, updates to the steering control system and increased suspension mount stiffness. Additionally, the RDX\'s all-wheel-drive system - AWD with Intelligent Control - has been tuned for greater rear torque bias to further enhance dynamic stability and all-weather performance.<br> <br> The 2016 RDX also gets key elements of Acura design DNA with restyled front and rear fasciae, including the addition of Acura\'s signature Jewel Eye™ LED headlights and LED taillights with light-pipe design on all models and a new three-dimensional grille treatment. The lower front and rear fascia areas also support the new look with fresh luxury details while all models receive new wheel designs.<br> <br> Inside, the new RDX gets a fresh look with a high-contrast silver and black trim plus significant upgrades to both standard and available luxury features and technology, including standard heated front seats and new second-row air-conditioning vents. The RDX with Technology Package adds a new 8-way adjustable power passenger\'s front seat (4-way power in base models), Acura\'s intuitive dual-screen On-Demand Multi-Information Display (ODMD), HD Radio®, blind spot information (BSI) and Rear Cross Traffic Monitor.<br> <br> A new Advance Package for the 2016 RDX adds rain-sensing wipers, front fog lights, Bi-Directional Keyless remote engine start, front and rear parking sensors, ventilated front seats, an auto-dimming driver\'s side mirror, and AcuraWatch™ advanced safety and driver-assistive technologies.

All RDX models with AcuraWatch™ also get a new 4.2-inch full-color TFT Multi-Information Display with expanded, customizable information readouts such as average vehicle speed, fuel economy, fuel range, tire pressure monitoring system (TMPS) and turn-by-turn navigation.<br> <br> While offered as standard equipment on the new Advance Package, all RDX models can now be equipped with the AcuraWatch™ suite of advanced safety and driver-assistive technologies, including Lane Departure Warning, Adaptive Cruise Control, Collision Mitigation Braking System™ and Lane Keeping Assist, along with a standard Multi-View Rear Camera and Expanded View driver\'s side mirror. AcuraWatch™ uses sensor fusion technology, the cooperative operation of a millimeter wave radar system and a windshield-mounted monocular camera to expand both the scope and fidelity of its sensing capabilities, including the ability to sense and respond to numerous road hazards, including a pedestrian detected in the roadway.<br> <br> In addition to the available AcuraWatch™ technologies, the 2016 RDX offers enhanced collision performance with numerous changes to its Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure that further improve frontal collision performance. The 2016 RDX targets top-in-class safety ratings - a 5-Star Overall Vehicle Score from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and a TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).<br> <br> The RDX is produced at the company\'s award-winning East Liberty, Ohio, plant, using domestic and globally sourced parts. In January, Acura marked the sale of its two-millionth North American-made vehicle in America. Today, approximately 94 percent of all Acura models sold in America are made in the company\'s plants in Ohio and Alabama.<br>','[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_11.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_12.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_13.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_14.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_15.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_16.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_17.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_18.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_19.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_20.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_21.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_22.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_23.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_24.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_25.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_26.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_27.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_28.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_29.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_30.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_31.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_32.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_33.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_34.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_35.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_36.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_37.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_4.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_5.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_6.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_7.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_8.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_9.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RDX-6078_10.jpg\"]','2024-10-23 05:32:33','2024-10-23 05:32:33'),(22,'c2aa2ed0','https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/acura-tlx-2015.html',2,'2015 Acua TLX Photos, engines &amp; full specs ','<p><strong>Acura introduced the TLX lineup as its mid-size sports sedan on the market, replacing both the TL and the TSX, and made it on top of the same platform as the Honda Accord.</strong></p><p></p><p>After the world financial crisis, Honda had to re-arrange its business, and thus it combined two Acura vehicles into one, namely the TLX. It was not just a facelifted version of an old car but a completely different one. It competed against Audi\'s A4 sedan and BMW\'s 3 Series, but despite sporting a shorter wheelbase than both of them, it was slightly longer.</p><p>The front fascia sported the Acura\'s shield-like chromed grille flanked by LED headlights, which looked like jewels aligned behind a common lens. From its profile, the ascending beltline emphasized the car\'s sporty character, while the sculptured lines on the door panels made it look even better. Finally, at the back, the automaker installed two exhausts neatly concealed under the bumper.</p><p>Inside, the cabin resembled the RLX but with better materials. Inside the instrument cluster, the automaker placed the large dials for the speedometer and tachometer, while on the center stack, it placed the infotainment screen, which was controlled by a rotary dial. Above it, Acura placed a second LCD for the navigation system. With room for four adults on long journeys, the TLX proved that Acura\'s idea to replace two vehicles with one was good.</p><p>Under the hood, the carmaker offered a choice of two engines: a 2.4-liter naturally aspirated inline-four and a 3.5-liter V6. Both of them sent the power to the front wheels only via either an eight- or nine-speed automatic.</p>','<strong>The 2015 Acura TLX is an all-new midsize sports sedan, the successor to the TL, and the third vehicle in Acura\'s re-envisioned performance-luxury sedan lineup, positioned between the ILX entry-luxury sedan and the RLX flagship Acura sedan.</strong><br> <br> Developed under the theme of \'Red Carpet Athlete,\' the all-new TLX is designed to deliver a unique and compelling blend of sports-sedan athleticism and premium (red-carpet) luxury refinement, while delivering on Acura\'s \'Synergy Between Man and Machine\' product direction - characterized by vehicles that perform \"at the will of the driver\" with intuitive, exhilarating and confidence-inspiring driving dynamics.<br> <br> To achieve its dual mission of even sharper sports-sedan performance and increased luxury refinement, the TLX employs a host of new technologies, including two new, high-output direct-injected i-VTEC engines; two advanced new transmissions, including the world\'s first automotive Dual Clutch Transmission with torque converter; and the latest iterations of Acura precision-handling technologies - Precision All-Wheel Steer (P-AWS), next-generation Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD), and Agile Handling Assist (AHA). These new technologies, in combination with its all-new body and chassis design, help define the TLX as the most dynamically advanced Acura ever produced; quick and responsive in sporty driving, stable and sure-footed in higher speed maneuvers, calm and quiet during long-distance cruising.<br> <br> The TLX was also designed to appeal to a broader cross-section of luxury sports-sedan customers, with a lower cost of entry and wider range of powertrain and drivetrain options. There are three distinct TLX model offerings:<br> <br> The TLX with 2.4-liter, 206-horsepower i-VTEC inline-4 with 8-speed Dual Clutch Transmission (8DCT) with torque converter, and Precision All-Wheel Steer (P-AWS);<br> The TLX with 3.5-liter, 290-horsepower i-VTEC V-6 with 9-speed automatic transmission and P-AWS;<br> And the TLX SH-AWD with next-generation Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive, available only with the 3.5-liter, 290 horsepower V-6 and 9-speed automatic.<br> <br> All three TLX models carry a long list of standard luxury comfort, convenience and safety features. TLX models with the 2.4-liter engine can be upgraded to the Technology package and models with the 3.5-liter engine are available with Technology or the line-topping Advance Package.<br> <br> <strong>Design and Packaging</strong><br> <br> The TLX\'s new chassis, powertrains and precision-handling technologies are wrapped in a lithe new exterior design with taut body surfaces, dynamically sculpted fender arches, and purposeful character lines. Its sporting character is emphasized by more compact sports-sedan proportions: Compared to the 2014 TL, the 2015 TLX is 3.7-inches shorter in overall length while maintaining the same wheelbase and tandem (front-to-rear) passenger-seating distance. The TLX\'s front and rear overhangs are shortened by 1.1 inches and 2.7 inches, respectively, when compared to the outgoing TL.<br> <br> Acura\'s signature Jewel Eye™ LED headlights, standard on all models, lend the TLX an advanced and bright-eyed appearance while producing superior down-the-road illumination. Its LED lighting theme carries through to the LED-accented side mirrors, LED taillights and LED license plate illumination.<br> <br> The TLX also features a new 60/40-split folding rear seatback for greater cargo-carrying flexibility and a new trunk design featuring a wider and deeper opening, a lower lift-over height, a fully flat cargo floor, and two new optional underfloor storage compartments.<br> <br> <strong>Body</strong><br> <br> The TLX body is designed to support the twin goals expressed in the vehicle\'s \"Red Carpet Athlete\" development theme - significantly enhanced luxury appeal, in terms of cabin quietness, ride comfort and styling refinement, and exhilarating and athletic sports-sedan performance - while also achieving class-leading fuel economy and crash safety ratings.<br> <br> To achieve these sometimes-competing goals, Acura engineers created an all-new body design utilizing advanced materials, including ultra-high-strength steels, aluminum and magnesium, for rigidity, collision performance and weight savings. Special attention was paid to local body rigidity in areas where the body meets up with the suspension, engine and subframes, and to improvements in body sealing and noise insulation.<br> <br> Vehicle aerodynamics also played a critical role in achieving class-leading fuel economy ratings. The TLX aerodynamics are improved by 15 percent (CdA) over the previous TL and based on internal testing, is the best (lowest) in its competitive class. At the same time, the body also is designed to provide a high level of occupant crash protection incorporating Acura\'s latest thinking in advanced body design, including the next-generation of Acura\'s Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) front body structure and one-piece hot-stamped-steel door ring, first applied to the all-new 2014 Acura MDX.<br> <br> Key TLX body features found in this section include:<br> <br> Rigid, lightweight body<br> Hemmed rear wheel arch<br> Ultra-high strength steel<br> Aluminum components<br> Magnesium steering hanger beam<br> Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body structure<br> Jewel Eye™ LED Headlights<br> LED fog-, tail-, puddle-, license- and side-mirror lights<br> Auto-dimming side mirrors<br> Acoustic glass windshield<br> Acoustic foam applied to critical body sections<br> Electric trunk lid and fuel lid release<br> Cap-less refueling<br> Expanded View Driver\'s Mirror<br> Exclusive Acura exterior colors (Black-Bronze and Acura Silver Metallic)<br> <br> <strong>Dynamic and Athletic Proportions</strong><br> <br> With its low and wide stance, the new 2015 TLX possesses a lithe exterior form, taut body surfaces and \"just right\" proportions for a sports sedan. This sporting character is further defined by shortened front and rear overhangs, dynamically sculpted fender arches, and purposeful character lines. Even the sculpted hood, with its sharply creased bilateral ridgelines, hints at the performance capabilities of the advanced new Acura powertrains it conceals. Meanwhile, the open and airy greenhouse provides commanding sight lines, with slim A-pillars providing improved visibility.<br> <br> <strong>\"Just Right\" Dimensions</strong><br> <br> The 2015 TLX\'s \"just right\" body dimensions result from a careful balance of aerodynamic efficiency, interior roominess, dynamic performance, quietness and refinement, and design. Compared to the previous TL, the new TLX has the same 109.3-inch wheelbase, but is 3.8 inches shorter in overall length at 190.3 inches. This positions it between the smaller ILX entry-luxury sedan and flagship RLX sedan. Despite its more compact exterior footprint, the TLX offers a spacious interior that approaches the previous TL.<br> <br> In comparison to its competitors, the TLX is longer than the Audi A4, BMW 3-Series, Lexus IS and Mercedes-Benz C-Class. It is also significantly wider than all of its direct competitors, including the Lexus ES and GS, and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.<br> <br> <strong>Rigid Lightweight Body</strong><br> <br> Light weight and rigidity are the twin foundations for TLX comfort, handling and safety performance. Light weight is achieved by a combination of advanced engineering and the use of high-strength steel, magnesium and aluminum unit-body components. TLX body rigidity is enhanced by precise engineering, particularly in optimizing key component fitting points (up to 25 percent stiffer) for superior bending stiffness, and the unit-body structure\'s torsional rigidity is up 21-percent vs. the previous TL.<br> <br> <strong>Aerodynamic Efficiency</strong><br> <br> In order to improve fuel efficiency and lower emissions, Acura designers merged the TLX\'s dynamic styling with a high level of aerodynamic efficiency, with a reduction in frontal area and lower running resistance (the amount of energy that is lost as the car moves along the road and through the air) as key goals.<br> <br> Most of the running-resistance improvements are achieved via refinements to the TLX\'s body design, with even the smallest details calculated and confirmed by the use of sophisticated computational fluid dynamics (CFD), as well as scale wind tunnel and high-precision coast-down testing.<br> <br> The new TLX is 0.4-inch lower and 1.0-inch narrower, with a slightly longer roofline, than the previous TL model. The result is 1.5-percent less frontal area than the previous TL, along with a 15-percent improvement in aerodynamics (CdA). Slightly narrower 225mm wide tires also replace the 245mm wide tires on the TL, further improving running efficiency. The end result is 16-percent reduction in running resistance compared to the previous TL. Internal testing shows the TLX to be the most aerodynamically efficient car in its class.<br> <br> <strong>Hemmed Rear Wheel Arch</strong><br> <br> The rear wheel arches on the TLX use a special roll-hemming process that results in a cleaner edge and smoother appearance than on the previous TL model. In simple terms, the wheel-arch \"hems\" are the curved sheet-metal edges that surround the rear tires. In the new TLX, a special hemming process is used instead of spot welds to join the inner and outer fender sheet-metal on the inside of the fender opening. The result is a reduced tire-to-fender gap which improves aerodynamics, elimination of visible spot-welds and a cleaner appearance.<br> <br> <strong>High Strength Steel</strong><br> <br> To achieve the high rigidity that promotes a smooth and quiet ride, crisp steering and handling, safety performance and long-term durability, the TLX utilizes six different grades of high-strength steel (HSS) in 52% of its body structure by weight. This high-grade, high-tensile strength steel adds the required rigidity for these positive traits without adding excessive weight, which in turn enhances fuel efficiency and lowers emissions. Altogether, 59-percent of the TLX body is created from a combination of high-strength steel, aluminum and magnesium.<br> <br> High strength steel uses include:<br> <br> UISBOR - USIBOR is a boron-alloyed steel with an aluminum-silicon coating that protects against oxidation during the heating, forming and hardening process. This high-strength hot-stamp steel is used for the TLX\'s door opening rings, for 5% of the unit body.<br> 980 grade HSS - Used in certain key structural points such as the front edges of the door sills, and in the A-pillars and B-pillars, for 2% of the unit body.<br> 780 grade HSS - Used for most structural load paths for ACE™, including the side sills and forward spars of unit body, for 2% of the unit body.<br> 590 grade HSS - Used for the front frame spars, floor and roof supports, for 35% of the unit body.<br> 440 grade HSS - Used in the front bulkhead, and in front and rear energy-absorbing structures, for 5% of the unit body.<br> 340 grade HSS - Sheet steel is used in the roof, for 3% of the unit body.<br> <br> <strong>Aluminum Components</strong><br> <br> Aluminum stampings are used in certain key locations to reduce the TLX\'s curb weight, which provides benefits in handling, fuel efficiency and emissions reductions. Altogether, the aluminum components comprise 6-percent of the TLX\'s body weight, a savings of 27.8 pounds compared to comparable steel components.<br> <br> Among the aluminum body components are:<br> <br> Hood<br> Front bumper beam<br> Rear bumper beam<br> Front subframe (hybrid aluminum/steel)<br> <br> <strong>Magnesium Steering Hanger Beam</strong><br> <br> Located behind the instrument panel, a 3-piece magnesium steering-hanger beam replaces the 26-piece aluminum and steel unit in the previous TL model. Its purpose is as a structural attachment point for the steering column, pedals and instrument panel, as well as a structural element that helps the passenger cabin retain its shape in certain collisions. This single robust magnesium component makes up 2-percent of the TLX\'s body weight.<br> <br> The steering-hanger beam offers several advantages compared to the previous unit:<br> <br> Simpler construction — Created from just three parts instead of the previous 26 different extrusions and stampings, the new magnesium steering hanger brace offers better construction precision.<br> Lighter weight — The magnesium steering hanger beam saves 2.7 pounds compared to a comparable aluminum and steel, contributing to the TLX\'s superior ride and handling, fuel efficiency and low emissions.<br> Better fit and finish — The exacting tolerances of the magnesium steering hanger brace in turn allow the instrument panel to fit better, exhibiting higher overall interior quality.<br> <br> <strong>LED Lighting</strong><br> <br> The most comprehensive use of LED lighting on any Acura vehicle is a signature design element of the new TLX. From the dramatic Jewel Eye™ headlights to the convenient new puddle lights and back to the new taillights, the LED lighting provides crisp, bright, energy-efficient and long-lasting illumination that directly improves the driving and ownership experience. A summary of exterior lighting includes:<br> <br> <strong>Forward Lighting</strong><br> <br> New LED headlights with incandescent-bulb turn signals<br> New LED parking and side marker lights<br> New LED under-mirror puddle lights (Advance grades)<br> LED front fog lights (Advance grades)<br> <br> <strong>Rear Lighting</strong><br> <br> New LED tail and trunk-lid lights with incandescent-bulb turn signals and backup lights<br> New LED Center High Mount Stop Lights (CHMSL) with integrated cover<br> LED license-plate lights<br> <br> <strong>Jewel Eye™ LED Headlights</strong><br> <br> Acura\'s signature Jewel Eye™ LED headlights give the TLX with an advanced and appearance while producing superior down-the-road illumination. The headlights utilize an array of high-intensity LED lamps to deliver outstanding light distribution, distant irradiation performance and light characteristics with a wavelength close to the human eye\'s luminosity curve. With five \"Jewel Eye\" lights per headlight, the LED lights provide improved down the road visibility compared to HID and halogen headlights.<br> <br> On each side of the TLX, the low beams consist of three LED lights, while the innermost LED lights are utilized for high beams. The daytime running light (DRL) function utilizes all five lenses illuminated by LED\'s that are clearly and dramatically visible even in bright sunlight. Altogether, they create a dramatic and distinctive appearance with superior lighting capability.<br> <br> <strong>Light distribution</strong><br> <br> Both the low and separate high beam LED headlights offer outstanding performance in all nighttime driving conditions, including highway, winding roads, intersections, and in inclement weather conditions. The result is that the driver can see further with uniformity, making high-speed nighttime driving easier and less fatiguing.<br> <br> A summary of LED benefits include:<br> <br> Outstanding light distribution that surpasses competitors<br> Excellent distant illumination performance<br> Clear illumination of the road surface and white lines<br> High visibility of the entire visible color spectrum (white, red, green, blue and yellow) compared to HID and halogen headlights<br> Response time when switching between low and high beam is shortened<br> Light congruity is improved between low and high beams<br> <br> <strong>Power savings</strong><br> <br> Using just 65 watts total, the TLX\'s LED headlights use 41-percent less power than traditional halogen headlights, contributing to the TLX\'s overall operating efficiency.<br> <br> <strong>Long lasting</strong><br> <br> Besides producing better light characteristics with lower energy usage, the TLX\'s LED headlights are longer lasting. With an estimated life expectancy of 10,000 hours, the LED headlights are projected to last five times longer than HID headlights and 10 times longer than traditional halogen headlight bulbs — contributing to less frequent replacement and potential associated cost savings. Further, their compact packaging allow for an improved aerodynamic frontal design.<br> <br> <strong>LED Fog Lights</strong><br> <br> Included in the Advance Package, LED fog lights are positioned at the lower corners of the TLX\'s front fascia for maximum effectiveness and a bold appearance.<br> <br> <strong>LED Taillights</strong><br> <br> LED taillights are part of the TLX\'s comprehensive exterior lighting array. Highly stylized to compliment the TLX body design, they are also brighter than traditional incandescent-bulb taillights, with a longer projected lifespan. Use of LEDs allows the addition of a \"light pipe\" styling element extending across the top of the lenses, contributing to the TLX\'s unique blend of design and engineering.<br> <br> <strong>LED Puddle Lights</strong><br> <br> Included in the standard Smart Entry system, LED puddle lights positioned on the undersides of both side mirror housings enhance convenience when entering or leaving the vehicle. The LEDs automatically illuminate when the TLX detects the key fob approaching, in concert with the automatic interior illumination. The puddle lights also illuminate when the driver puts the TLX in Park and leaves the vehicle, fading off after about two seconds after locking the doors, or 30 seconds if the doors are not locked.<br> <br> <strong>LED Side Mirror Lights</strong><br> <br> Keying off of the Jewel Eye™ LED headlights, each TLX mirror has LED lights fused into the mirror housing. The LEDs come to life when the turn indictors are activated, providing extra visibility and a high tech appearance.<br> <br> <strong>Auto-Dimming Side Mirrors</strong><br> <br> Included in the Advance Package, auto-dimming side mirrors use the same activation sensor as the TLX\'s auto-dimming inside rearview mirror. The auto-dimming function of all three mirrors helps reduce glare during nighttime driving, especially from the headlights of following vehicles. Mirror glass area is 24-percent greater than on the previous TL model for improved rear visibility.<br> <br> <strong>Expanded View Driver\'s Mirror</strong><br> <br> An Expanded View Driver\'s Mirror performs like two mirrors in one. The larger, inset portion of the mirror is relatively flat and works like a conventional sideview mirror to show objects to the side of the vehicle. The outer portion of the mirror is optically convex and functions as a wide-angle mirror to expand the driver\'s view to the side by approximately 39 percent, helping to reduce the blind-zone area.<br> <br> <strong>Acoustic Glass</strong><br> <br> To reduce noise in the cabin The TLX utilizes a 4.5-mm thick, 3-layer acoustic windshield that consists of two layers of safety glass, separated by a thin acoustic resin center. The windshield reduces wind noise on in the higher frequency ranges, contributing to a luxurious feeling of isolation in the cabin. Also helping to mitigate wind, road and traffic noise in the cabin is 5.0-mm thick front door glass.<br> <br> <strong>Auto Up-Down Side Windows</strong><br> <br> The 2015 TLX has power front and rear side windows with an auto-open and auto-close feature with anti-pinch.<br> <br> <strong>Advanced Windshield Wiper System</strong><br> <br> The sleek, flat design of the wiper blades adds to the TLX\'s visual appeal. The flat blade design improves aerodynamic performance and reduces wind noise.<br> <br> <strong>Headlights On With Wipers</strong><br> <br> Laws in some states require drivers to turn on the headlights when the wipers are operating in the rain. The new TLX helps its driver comply with these laws by automatically illuminating the headlights when the wipers are activated for five cycles or more (with headlight switch in AUTO). The headlights will remain illuminated for as long as the rain continues and the wipers are being operated. When the rain stops, the wiper activation also ceases, with the headlights remaining lit until the wipers stop. Operation is shown via an indicator on the instrument panel.<br> <br> <strong>Rain Sensing Wipers</strong><br> <br> TLX models equipped with Technology Package and Advance Package include rain-sensing wipers that automatically activate if water is detected on the windshield.<br> <br> <strong>Noise Mitigation</strong><br> <br> The TLX was designed to deliver vault-like quietness in all driving conditions, with major improvements achieved through enhancements in body stiffness, body and door sealing, and widespread sound insulation.<br> <br> <strong>Acoustic Spray Foam</strong><br> <br> Applied to the unit body in 10 crucial locations around the door openings, acoustic spray foam helps create a solid foundation for a quieter cabin. The application process is automated and computer controlled, with the foam curing in 7 to 11 seconds after application for a highly precise and effective process.<br> <br> <strong>Additional Materials and Sealing</strong><br> <br> Additional sound-absorptive materials are used throughout the unit body and interior, each dedicated to blocking a particular noise type and frequency. The materials include Thinsulate insulation, body sealers, noise-absorbing carpeting, and a high-density and dual density melt sheets. Liquid Applied Sound Deadening (LASD) is used in the trunk. Key areas of attention include the TLX\'s dashboard lower and floor area. Total body leakage is reduced 50 percent vs. the outgoing TL. The end result is reduced road noise and drumming on both concrete and asphalt surfaces, along with lower engine noise, for a more relaxing and pleasant driving experience.<br> <br> <strong>Wind Noise</strong><br> <br> Significant improvements in both high-frequency and mid-frequency noise heard in the cabin were achieved by lowering the windshield-wiper height and optimizing the shape of the side mirrors. Special sealing methods in the B-pillars and C-pillars, and between the door gaps, further reduce audible wind noise.<br> <br> <strong>Improved Door Sealing</strong><br> <br> The new TLX adopts the previous TL\'s 360-degree double seals that completely surround each passenger door. In addition, the TLX uses a third set of gap seals, positioned at the front, center, rear and bottom edges of each door, that help eliminate potential noise source caused by turbulent airflow in the cavities around the door hinges and latches. The doors\' internal steel stampings receive further sound insulation in the form of large acoustic hole seals, internal foam sound barriers, and specially targeted B-pillar plugs.<br> <br> <strong>Trunk Storage</strong><br> <br> The base TLX and TLX with Technology package offer a 13.2 cu. ft. of cargo volume, while the TLX with Advance Package has a larger 14.3 cu. ft. of cargo volume. There is no difference in storage capacity for the TLX two-wheel-drive models and TLX SH-AWD.<br> <br> Compared to the previous TL, the trunk features an easier load-in height, a wider opening, and a flat, wide trunk floor that makes loading and unloading cargo easier. In specific, the interior dimensions are 14-percent wider, 12-percent deeper, with a 15-percent lower load-in height than the TL dimensions. The new flat floor extends from the rear bumper area, forward to the rear seatback for improved usability. The trunk hinges are fully hidden for a better visual appearance and to eliminate the possibility of catching on stored items. New 60/40 split-folding rear seatbacks allow storage of large or bulky items such as bicycles, skis or boards, or flat-screen televisions.<br> <br> <strong>Cargo Bin System</strong><br> <br> All TLX models include a versatile trunk underfloor storage system that provides convenient storage for such items as groceries, emergency tools and other small items. The flip-up floor reveals a pair of storage bins (or a larger single bin with the Advance Package). These bins are ideal for everyday items such as groceries, shoes, etc. Flipping the floor panel again reveals an additional storage area designed for emergency tools, jumper cables, etc. A molded carrier holding the TLX\'s towing eyebolt and tire-inflator kit is also located in this area. Finally, the Advance Package includes a reversible floor panel. Carpeted on one side, it features a plastic surface on the backside to be used when wet or messy items — for instance, wetsuits, beach towels or a car cover — need to be carried in the trunk.<br> <br> <strong>Exterior Colors</strong><br> <br> The 2015 TLX is available in seven exterior colors, including two metallic and five pearl colors. All colors have a strong character, offering expressive contrasts that compliment the TLX\'s body-panel curves and angles, while also exhibiting a smart luxury appearance. The acid-resistant epoxy clear-coat paint is superior to typical clear-coat paints for increased resistance to urban pollutants.<br> <br> <strong>Acura TLX Exterior Colors</strong><br> <br> Acura Silver Metallic (New)<br> Basque Red Pearl<br> Bellanova White Pearl<br> Bronze-Black Pearl (New)<br> Crystal Black Pearl<br> Graphite Luster Metallic<br> Obsidian Blue Pearl<br> <br> <strong>Interior</strong><br> <br> The TLX interior is designed and engineered to support the Red Carpet Athlete development theme of the new TLX, providing a high degree of refinement, luxury comfort and technological sophistication while supporting an exhilarating driving experience.

A switch located in the glove compartment can disable the electric trunk release feature. The owner then locks the glove compartment and gives the valet the TLX remote fob with the emergency backup key removed. This allows the valet to drive, lock or unlock the vehicle, without having access to the glove box or trunk.<br> <br> <strong>GPS-Linked, Dual-Zone Automatic Climate Control</strong><br> <br> The TLX has a GPS-linked (when equipped with navigation system) temperature control, dual-zone automatic climate control system that lets the driver and front passenger set temperatures to their individual liking.<br> <br> To operate the HVAC system, easy-to-read buttons and controls are positioned within convenient reach. The HVAC system can also be controlled by voice command, and additional custom settings can be accessed through the 7-inch On-Demand Multi-Use Display™ interface. The climate control system\'s control logic is designed to provide smooth operation with subtle changes in airflow.<br> <br> With its position-sensing ability, the available GPS navigation system contributes to overall passenger comfort with a 3D solar sensing feature. Based on continuously updated vehicle position information, the navigation system determines the position of the sun relative to the driver and passenger. Combining this information with input from a solar sensor located on top of the instrument panel, the climate control system automatically adjusts the temperature from side to side as needed to compensate for asymmetrical solar heating. Further, on the Advance Package, the heated and ventilated front seats are electronically linked to the climate control system.<br> <br> <strong>Siri™ Eyes Free</strong><br> <br> Siri™ Eyes Free is standard on the TLX. When the TLX\'s Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® system is paired with a compatible iPhone, Siri Eyes Free allows you to use many of the features of Siri without removing your hands from the steering wheel. A push of approximately two seconds on the steering wheel-mounted \"talk\" button activates Siri in the TLX. After the Siri chime sounds, the driver can ask a question, set up a calendar entry and more. Siri offers a wide range of capabilities including sending and reading aloud text and email messages, setting alarms and reminders, checking the weather, posting to social media sites and much more. Siri can also find a point of interest, then provide turn-by-turn audio directions when the audio system is set to Bluetooth® audio or iPod mode. The system switches automatically to Bluetooth audio when playing a song or artist.<br> <br> <strong>Chassis</strong><br> <br> The 2015 Acura TLX utilizes a newly designed chassis that incorporates next-generation versions of two pinnacle Acura super-handling technologies - Precision All-Wheel Steer™ (P-AWS) and Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD™). Both technologies are engineered to deliver intuitive and precise dynamic capabilities in a vehicle that responds directly and accurately to the will of the driver. These next-generation technologies are anchored by the TLX\'s rigid unit-body structure and its MacPherson strut front and multi-link rear suspension with Amplitude Reactive Dampers (ARD). Stable and responsive vehicle dynamic behavior is further aided by Acura\'s Agile Handling Assist (AHA) technology and, in emergency maneuvers, by Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA).<br> <br> These chassis features help define the TLX as the most advanced Acura ever produced from a dynamic standpoint, a vehicle that supports the needs of the driver in all conditions - quick and responsive in sporty driving environments; stable and sure-footed in emergency maneuvers; calm and quiet during long-distance cruising - all based on the will of the driver.<br> <br> The TLX also allows a substantial degree of customization through its Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) with four modes - ECON, Normal, Sport and Sport+ settings - that take the TLX from soothing to scintillating all at the touch of a button.<br> <br> <strong>Front Cast-Aluminum and Steel Subframe</strong><br> <br> In a first for Acura, the TLX employs a cast-aluminum and steel \"hybrid\" front subframe to reduce road surface vibration and shock inputs for a smoother, quieter ride. The new subframe supports the engine, transmission, front suspension and steering system. The front section of the subframe is steel, and the rear section is cast aluminum. The sections are joined with a newly developed friction-stir-welding process to form a single high-strength, lightweight unit that provides ideal ride and handling properties. Altogether, the front subframe, along with a lower arm hydro-bushing, reduces vertical and fore/aft forces felt at front seats by 61 percent and 46 percent, respectively, compared to the previous TL model.<br> <br> <strong>MacPherson Strut Front Suspension</strong><br> <br> MacPherson strut front suspension with Amplitude Reactive Dampers provides precise and engaging handling performance, a responsive feel for the driver, and luxurious ride quality. Specially tuned hydro-compliance bushings improve resistance to shimmy and while also reducing brake judder, further improving the TLX\'s refinement and driving character. All TLX models have a 26.0 mm diameter tubular (hollow) front stabilizer bar.<br> <br> <strong>Rear Steel Subframe</strong><br> <br> Constructed of high-tensile steel, the rear subframe uses hydraulic mounts, along with increased fitting-point stiffness, to reduce road surface vibration and shock inputs for a smooth ride and low noise. The rear subframe reduces vertical and fore/aft forces felt at front seats by 31 percent and 33 percent, respectively compared to the previous TL model. In addition, on TLX models with Super-Handling All Wheel Drive (SH-AWD), the rear subframe features a 4-point differential mounting system. Its bushing rates are specially calibrated to reduce the transmission of driveline noise and vibration into the vehicle body, while also helping to maintain ride quality.<br> <br> <strong>Multi-Link Rear Suspension</strong><br> <br> Multi-link rear suspension with Amplitude Reactive Dampers provides optimal handling agility, driver confidence and ride sophistication. Geometry, including rear toe control, is optimized for handling competence, stability and a sophisticated ride in a variety of urban, highway and open road scenarios. The system includes multi-link control arms, control-arm bushings that are optimized for the best blend of noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) isolation and handling precision, and Amplitude Reactive Dampers. Both the 4-cylinder and SH-AWD models have a 24.7 mm diameter rear stabilizer bar, while the front-wheel drive V-6 has a 25.4 mm diameter stabilizer bar.<br> <br> <strong>Amplitude Reactive Dampers (ARD)</strong><br> <br> Acura\'s Amplitude Reactive Dampers provide both superior ride comfort and sporty handling, helping the new TLX provide a truly engaging driving experience in all driving situations. Two separate damping mechanisms are utilized, with one tuned for maximum efficiency on smoother roads with small inputs and the other tuned to handle large inputs such as rough roads, potholes, and sudden steering and braking action. Front triple-path damper mounts further improve ride comfort without sacrificing handling. The result is a vehicle that remains composed and comfortable in a wide range of conditions.<br> <br> The core technology contained within the Amplitude Reactive Dampers is their two separate damping pistons, including a main piston and a second piston. To improve overall ride comfort, when smaller inputs occur during normal driving conditions, only the main piston works to provide the ideal damping characteristics. To improve the TLX\'s ride and handling during more severe conditions, the second piston operates to provide additional damping force.<br> <br> Amplitude Reactive Dampers operate on a purely mechanical basis that does not require electronic controls.<br> <br> <strong>Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®)</strong><br> <br> The TLX\'s Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) works in conjunction with the Drive-by-Wire throttle system and ABS to enhance vehicle stability when cornering: If vehicle understeer or oversteer is detected, the system selectively reduces power and/or applies braking force to individual wheels to help correct the condition and stabilize the vehicle.<br> <br> VSA also supports the functioning of available driver-assistive technologies such as Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low-Speed Follow (LSF), Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS) and Road Departure Mitigation (RDM). The advantages of the latest VSA system on the new TLX include quicker response with smoother activation and more accurate control, improved brake-pedal feel and lower operating noise, vibration and harshness (NVH).<br> <br> In addition, traction control monitors front-wheel slippage, such as when starting on slick surfaces or patches of ice. If slippage is detected, traction control activates one or more brake calipers and reduces engine torque to slow the spinning wheel(s) so traction can be regained.<br> <br> <strong>Integrated Dynamic System (IDS)</strong><br> <br> ECON, Normal, Sport and Sport+ modes allow the driver to customize their driving experience. The modes are driver-selectable via a console-mounted button and are displayed on the Multi-Information Display located between the tachometer and speedometer. ECON, Normal and Sport are selectable as default, or last used modes, while Sport + defaults to Sport at ignition off, and must be reselected after a restart. ECON mode favors high fuel efficiency, while Normal mode is for everyday driving. Sport mode enhances throttle, EPS and P-AWS response or SH-AWD rear-wheel torque-vectoring control to sharpen vehicle dynamics, while Sport+ mode enhances transmission shift mapping, maximizing performance.<br> <br> <strong>Motion-Adaptive Electric Power Steering (MA-EPS)</strong><br> <br> The TLX\'s next-generation Motion-Adaptive Electric Power Steering offers precise direct feel, high energy-efficiency, tunable response and improved active safety. MA-EPS responds instantly to steering input and automatically changes the amount of power assist appropriate to the vehicle\'s speed. Its idealized steering effort and linearity, excellent on-center feel, minimal torque steer and maximum parking ease provides a satisfying driving experience under all conditions.<br> <br> <strong>Agile Handling Assist (AHA)</strong><br> <br> Agile Handling Assist (AHA) extends the P-AWS function by using the brakes in cornering to create yaw, or turning motion, helping the driver smoothly and easily trace the desired line with smaller steering-wheel inputs. AHA stabilizes the car earlier than conventional vehicle stability assist systems, resulting in more agile and engaging dynamic performance in everyday driving conditions.<br> <br> <strong>Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD)</strong><br> <br> The TLX SH-AWD features a new hydraulically-controlled iteration of Acura\'s acclaimed Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®), which progressively distributes optimum torque not only between the front and rear axles, but also between the left and right rear wheels. Like its P-AWS counterpart, the TLX SH-AWD system is complemented by the brake torque effect of Agile Handling Assist.<br> <br> The benefits of the SH-AWD system are superior all-weather handling and neutral, accurate steering under power. By rotating the outside rear wheel faster than the front axle while cornering, SH-AWD uses torque vectoring to create a yaw moment to help turn the vehicle through the corner — reducing understeer and improving controllability. With cornering forces more evenly distributed between front and rear tires, overall cornering power is increased — on wet or dry roads.<br> <br> This next-generation SH-AWD system is 25 percent lighter and utilizes new hydraulic control to overdrive the rear wheels by 2.7 percent (compared to 1.7 percent for the previous system), enabling greater turning forces at reduced speeds and in tighter corners.<br> <br> <strong>4-Wheel Disc Brakes with ABS and Brake Assist</strong><br> <br> The TLX is equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes with a 4-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS). The pedal feel is smooth and easy to modulate in light braking, and linear and pleasantly low-effort during medium and hard braking. The result is short, confident stops — with excellent pedal feel — under all conditions.<br> <br> The front discs measure 12.6 inches in diameter, while the rear discs measure 12.2 inches in diameter. Weighing a total of 2.5 pounds less than the previous TL brakes, the lighter-weight TLX brakes help improve ride quality, handling capability and fuel efficiency. The brake pads are a high-friction type to optimize response and peak stopping performance even under strenuous conditions. The brake calipers are designed to reduce brake drag when not in use, reducing rolling resistance and improving fuel efficiency in the process.<br> <br> The front brakes feature supplemental external vents that provide a second airflow path around the brake rotors, reducing thermal deformation by 51-percent. The byproduct of this better cooling is a 30 percent reduction in brake judder — felt by the driver as steering-wheel and brake-pedal vibration — during aggressive driving.<br> <br> ABS independently modulates braking power at each wheel to help the driver retain steering control during heavy braking, while Brake Assist recognizes emergency braking situations and almost instantly applies full braking force when appropriate.<br> <br> <strong>6-Piston Brake Modulator</strong><br> <br> The TLX employs a premium Bosch 6-piston brake modulator that provides the ultra-quick braking response required for Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA), Active Handling Assist (AHA), Low Speed Follow (LSF) operation, Road Departure Mitigation (RDM), and Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS). The brake modulator\'s function is to build braking pressure almost instantaneously, and utilizing six pistons — instead of the two pistons in the previous TL brake modulator — it delivers significantly quicker response than before.<br> <br> The new brake modulator also includes two additional pressure sensors, which ensure the smoothest possible pump operation. This reduces the potential vibration that might otherwise be felt through the TLX\'s unit-body and brake pedal, improving overall braking-system refinement to an unprecedented level. In addition, a special Active Noise Shaping (ANS) chip incorporated into the motor controller circuitry measurably reduces noise during brake modulator operation. The operating algorithms of the system are proprietary and developed by Acura engineers.<br> <br> <strong>Electric Parking Brake and Automatic Brake Hold</strong><br> <br> The combination of Electric Parking Brake (EPB) and Automatic Brake Hold meaningfully reduce the effort of driving the vehicle, thereby raising overall enjoyment and comfort for the driver.<br> <br> <strong>Wheels and Tires</strong><br> <br> All TLX models have 10-spoke aluminum alloy wheels, with the 2.4-liter TLX models featuring 17x7.5J wheels with black accents, while all V-6 models feature 18x7.5J wheels with gray accents.<br> <br> All TLX models feature high-performance all-season tires that help deliver an ideal balance of ride and handling, high fuel efficiency, and low noise, vibration and harshness (NVH). The 2.4-liter TLX models are equipped with 225/55R17 tires, and all V-6 TLX models are equipped with 225/50R18 tires.<br> <br> The wheel bearings are engineered with special low-drag seals that contribute to a 4.4-percent decrease in rolling resistance compared to a traditional wheel bearing seals.<br> <br> <strong>Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)</strong><br> <br> A standard Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) helps the driver maintain proper air pressure to improve driving safety and fuel efficiency, as well as reduce wear and tear on the vehicle\'s tires. Located in the Multi Information Display (MID), the TPMS graphic indicates the pressure in all four tires on a real-time basis. A TPMS icon illuminates to alert the driver whenever any of the tires has a significantly low-pressure reading that requires the driver\'s attention.<br> <br> <strong>Fill Assist</strong><br> <br> Debuting for Acura on the 2015 TLX is a technology called Fill Assist, which helps the driver inflate tire pressures to the correct level without using a pressure gauge. Instead, during inflation, Fill Assist sounds an audible alert when the tire reaches the required pressure.<br> <br> <strong>Tire Repair Kit</strong><br> <br> The TLX features an easy-to-use tire repair kit in lieu of a spare tire. This reduces weight and increases trunk volume, and simplifies temporary repairs in the event of a flat tire. Acura Roadside Assistance supports tire repairs. In addition, a temporary spare tire is available as a Genuine Acura Accessory.<br> <br> <strong>Capless Fueling System</strong><br> <br> The TLX\'s capless fueling eliminates the fuel cap, meaning that fueling the vehicle simply requires opening the fuel lid, refueling, and then closing the lid. This smart and easy-to-use design eliminates the need to touch a dirty fuel cap, reduces the possibility of damaging the vehicle\'s paint with the fuel cap or tether, or forgetting the fuel cap at the gas station. It also eliminates the possibility of activating an emissions warning by failing to properly re-install the fuel cap. And finally, the capless fueling system allows the use of a smaller fuel-cap door, which cleans up the lines of the vehicle.<br> <br> The system consists of two integrated components, including an outer shutter mechanism that prevents the intrusion of dirt and dust, and a self-sealing fueling flap that is closed by a torsion spring. Both operate automatically.<br> <br> At a gas station, the driver simply opens the fuel lid and then inserts the fuel nozzle. Inserting the nozzle automatically opens the outer shutter and fueling flap. When fueling is complete, removing the fuel nozzle automatically closes both the fueling flap and outer shutter.<br> <br> <strong>17.2-Gallon Fuel Capacity</strong><br> <br> The TLX\'s plastic fuel tank capacity of 17.2 gallons gives the TLX ample cruising range. The fuel tank is made of high-impact plastic for light weight and durability. The fuel tank is located in a protected area in front of the rear suspension.<br> <br> <strong>Powertrain</strong><br> <br> As Acura\'s premier sport sedan, the 2015 TLX offers more power and drivetrain choices than ever before, with two all-new direct-injected engines, two completely new advanced transmissions, and Acura\'s next-generation precision handling technology - Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®).<br> <br> The TLX is available in both all-wheel-drive and front-wheel drive layouts. Front-wheel drive models come standard with Acura Precision All-Wheel Steer (P-AWS) and can be equipped with either the 2.4-liter 4-cylinder, or 3.5-liter V6 engines. The TLX SH-AWD, with next-generation Super Handling All-Wheel Drive, is available only with the V-6 engine.<br> <br> The TLX\'s two new Direct Injection (DI) engines combine power and efficiency. The 2.4-liter DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine produces a peak 206 horsepower and 182 lb.-ft. of torque. It has more horsepower and substantially more torque—particularly in the mid-range—than the same-sized engine that powers the TSX sedan. Even though the TLX is larger and heavier than the outgoing TSX 4-cylinder, it actually posts superior EPA fuel-economy ratings of 24/35/281 mpg city/hwy/combined.<br> <br> A new 3.5-liter direct injected i-VTEC® 24-valve V-6 engine replaces the 3.5-liter and 3.7-liter engines in the TL. The new powerplant gains 10 horsepower (290 peak horsepower) and 13 lb.-ft. or torque (267 lb.-ft.) compared to the 3.5-liter V-6 in the TL sedan. To boost fuel efficiency, Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) automatically deactivates three of the engine\'s six cylinders under light engine loads. TLX SH-AWD models also add a new automatic idle-stop feature to further improve fuel efficiency.<br> <br> The front-wheel drive TLX with V-6 and P-AWS has an EPA fuel-economy rating of 21/34/251 mpg city/hwy/combined; the TLX SH-AWD is EPA rated at 21/31/251 mpg city/hwy/combined. Compared to the 2014 TL with automatic transmission, the front-wheel-drive TLX V-6 has a 17-percent increase in EPA highway fuel economy ratings, and the TLX SH-AWD has a 19-percent fuel economy-ratings gain.<br> <br> To make the most of these powerful, refined and efficient new engines, the TLX features two highly advanced new transmissions. 2.4-liter TLX models have a standard 8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) featuring Sequential SportShift, the world\'s first transmission of this type to be paired with a torque converter. The DCT, with its closely-spaced ratios, ultra-quick shifts and automatic downshift rev-matching, gives the 2.4-liter TLX an aggressively sporting feel. The torque converter provides exceptionally smooth operation in stop-and-go situations, plus it offers off-the-line torque multiplication for substantially improved initial acceleration that a DCT alone cannot equal.<br> <br> 3.5-liter TLX models are equipped with an all-new 9-speed automatic transmission featuring Sequential SportShift, which is substantially lighter than the 6-speed automatic in the previous TL. The transmission is engineered to handle the V-6\'s substantial power output, and its closely spaced gear ratios enhance performance and fuel efficiency. No competitive vehicle in the segment offers as many transmission ratios.<br> <br> A new generation of Acura\'s acclaimed Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ is standard in the TLX SH-AWD. SH-AWD progressively distributes torque not only between the front and rear axles, but also between the left and right rear wheels. Using torque vectoring to help turn the vehicle, SH-AWD creates a more responsive, neutral and predictable platform while providing outstanding all-weather confidence and control. In the TLX, torque-vectoring effectiveness has been greatly enhanced, benefiting responsiveness, agility and stability.<br> <br> Front-wheel drive models feature the latest version of Acura\'s Precision All-Wheel Steer™ (P-AWS), which, like SH-AWD, is designed to help give the TLX greater agility and handling balance.<br> <br> <strong>Direct-Injected 2.4-liter Inline 4-cylinder Engine</strong><br> <br> The TLX\'s new Direct Injection (DI) 2.4-liter DOHC i-VTEC 4-cylinder engine brings a host of intelligent technology to its segment. The engine\'s i-VTEC system combines VTC (Variable Timing Control), which continuously adjusts the intake camshaft phase, with Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC), which changes valve lift, timing and duration of the intake valves. A new Direct Injection (DI) system, dual-stage intake manifold and other technologies combine to produce up to 10-percent more torque as compared to the same sized engine that is standard in the TSX Sedan, with greater power available over the entire operating range. Peak power (206 horsepower) is also higher than that of the TSX engine, with the peak arriving at 6,800 rpm instead of 7,000 rpm.<br> <br> Fuel economy ratings are exceptional, due in part to efficient Direct Injection, a new combustion chamber design, offset cylinder bores and a range of friction-reducing technologies. The TLX equipped with the 2.4-liter engine and standard 8-speed dual-clutch transmission has an EPA fuel-economy rating of 24/35/281 mpg city/hwy/combined. That\'s a significant increase over the smaller TSX sedan, which was rated at 22/31/261 when equipped with an automatic transmission. The 4-cylinder engine meets ULEV-2 emissions standards in select states, and Federal Tier 2, Bin 5 standards.<br> <br> <strong>4-Cylinder Engine Block, Crankshaft and Pistons</strong><br> <br> The TLX\'s 2.4-liter engine has a lightweight die-cast aluminum block with a single main-bearing cradle design that creates a rigid assembly to help minimize noise and vibration. Cast-in iron cylinder liners provide long-lasting durability. Each journal on the forged-steel crankshaft is micropolished to reduce internal friction. To improve smoothness throughout the rpm range and help lower noise levels, the engine is fitted with an internal balancer unit. Consisting of a pair of chain-driven counter-rotating shafts located in the lower block and integrated into the oil pan, the balancing system helps quell the inherent second-order harmonic vibrations that normally impact inline 4-cylinder engines.<br> <br> To reduce piston-sliding friction, the cylinder bores are offset by 8.0 mm from the crankshaft. This gives the connecting rods a more favorable angle during each power stroke, which reduces side loading on the pistons and in turn, improves efficiency. The engine features a forged crankshaft for high rigidity and low friction. Lightweight pistons have a carefully optimized skirt design to minimize reciprocating weight, and reduced weight minimizes vibration and increases operating efficiency. The piston crowns are dished, to help maintain stable combustion and to optimize distribution of the stratified fuel charge from the direct injector in each cylinder. This close control over the combustion process boosts overall operating efficiency.<br> <br> <strong>4-Cylinder Dual-Stage Intake Manifold</strong><br> <br> To maximize power output, the 2.4-liter engine has a dual-stage intake manifold has two different intake runner lengths that are selected based on the operating conditions. An actuator and a set of four butterfly valves control the intake runner switching process. At low engine speeds, the long runners are used to improve low-end torque. At higher engine speeds the system switches to the short intake runners for greater high rpm power. The result is intake tuning that is optimized for the engine\'s entire operating range.<br> <br> <strong>2.4-liter Engine Cylinder Head and Valvetrain</strong><br> <br> The lightweight cylinder head is made of pressure-cast aluminum alloy, with exhaust passages cast directly into the cylinder head. This eliminates the need for a traditional separate exhaust manifold and allows the close-coupled catalytic converter to be mounted directly to the cylinder head.<br> <br> A silent-chain drives the dual overhead cams and features a double-arm tensioner design that reduces operating friction. The cam drive is designed to be maintenance free throughout the life of the engine.<br> <br> To help boost fuel efficiency and power, the combustion chamber shape and valve angles have been optimized. The included valve angle is a narrow 35 degrees, which decreases the surface-to-volume ratio and helps create a flatter, more compact combustion chamber that reduces unburned hydrocarbon emissions. With this combustion chamber shape and the precise control of direct injection, the compression ratio set at 11.6:1.<br> <br> The cylinder head features a new \"tumble port\" intake design. In combination with the new combustion chamber and piston crown shape, the design\'s high level of airflow tumble helps create a homogenous fuel mixture for low fuel consumption and high airflow for high power output.<br> <br> <strong>2.4-Liter Engine i-VTEC Valve Control System</strong><br> <br> The TLX\'s direct-injected 2.4-liter DOHC 16-valve i-VTEC engine uses an advanced valve-control system to combine high power output with high fuel efficiency and low emissions. The system combines VTC (Variable Timing Control), which continuously adjusts the intake camshaft phase, with Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC), which changes valve lift, timing and duration of the intake valves.<br> <br> At low rpm, the VTEC intake valve timing and lift are optimized for high torque and low fuel consumption.. As engine rpm builds past 4,900 rpm, the VTEC system transitions to a high-lift, long-duration intake cam profile for superior high-rpm engine power.<br> <br> The \"intelligent\" portion of the system is its ability to continuously vary the timing of the intake cam relative to that of the exhaust camshaft. This helps boost power and also provides a smoother idle (allowing idle speed to be reduced). The intake cam timing is varied based on input from sensors that monitor rpm, timing, throttle opening, cam position and exhaust air-fuel ratio. The result is increased fuel efficiency and lower NOx emissions.<br> <br> <strong>3.5-liter V-6 Engine</strong><br> <br> The TLX 3.5-liter i-VTEC® V-6 is closely related to the 3.5-liter V-6 that powers the RLX and MDX. It has a die-cast lightweight aluminum alloy block with cast-in-place iron cylinder liners, a smooth-firing 60-degree V-angle, and compact overall dimensions. As in the 2014 Acura RLX and MDX, the TLX powerplant combines Direct Injection with i-VTEC and Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) to give the TLX impressive fuel economy ratings and overall performance. This clean-running engine meets ULEV-2 emissions standards in select states, and Federal Tier 2, Bin 5 standards.<br> <br> A wide range of improvements, including revised intake and exhaust ports and new valve timing, help make the 3.5-liter V-6 more powerful than the 3.5-liter V-6 engine it replaces. The aluminum-alloy 24-valve engine produces 290 horsepower at 6,200 rpm and generates 267 lb-ft of torque at 4,500 rpm — gains of 10 horsepower and 13 lb.-ft., respectively. Torque has also improved throughout the entire operating range, with the most substantial gains at low rpm, aiding the TLX\'s responsiveness.<br> <br> The new V-6 contributes to a 17-percent increase in the EPA highway fuel-economy rating of the 2015 TLX with front-wheel drive, and a 19-percent gain in the TLX SH-AWD, when compared with the 2014 TL. The TLX V-6 equipped with the standard 9-speed automatic transmission and Precision All-Wheel Steer has an EPA fuel-economy rating of 21/34/251 mpg city/hwy/combined. The TLX SH-AWD has a rating of 21/31/251 mpg city/hwy/combined.<br> <br> <strong>V-6 Engine Block and Crankshaft</strong><br> <br> With its 60-degree V-angle, the TLX\'s available V-6 engine has compact overall dimensions that allow efficient packaging within the vehicle. The V-6 has a die-cast lightweight aluminum alloy block with cast-in-place iron cylinder liners. Made with a centrifugal spin-casting process, the thin-wall liners are high in strength and low in porosity. The block incorporates a deep-skirt design with four bolts per bearing cap for rigid crankshaft support and minimized noise and vibration. The 3.5-liter V-6 uses a high-strength steel crankshaft for minimum weight. A cooling control spacer positioned in the water jacket surrounding the cylinders helps control warm-up and operating cylinder liner temperatures to reduce friction.<br> <br> <strong>V-6 Pistons/Connecting Rods</strong><br> <br> Designed with \"cavity-shaped\" crowns, the V-6 engine\'s pistons help maintain stable combustion and contribute to optimized combustion. Ion-plated piston rings help reduce friction for greater operating efficiency. The compression ratio (relative to the 2014 TL 3.5- and 3.7-liter engines) has risen from 11.2:1 to 11.5:1. Heavy-duty steel connecting rods are forged in one piece and then the connecting rods are \"crack separated\" to create a lighter and stronger rod with an optimally fitted bearing cap.<br> <br> <strong>V-6 Cylinder Heads and Valvetrain</strong><br> <br> Like other Acura V-6 powerplants, the TLX engine\'s 4-valve cylinder heads are a single-overhead-camshaft design, with the cams driven by the crankshaft via an automatically tensioned toothed belt. Made of low-pressure cast, low-porosity aluminum, each cylinder head incorporates a laminar flow intake design that improves combustion efficiency by creating a more homogeneous fuel-air mixture. An integrated exhaust manifold cast into each cylinder head reduces parts count, saves weight, improves flow and optimizes the location of the close-coupled catalyst.<br> <br> <strong>V-6 i-VTEC with 2-Stage Variable Cylinder Management™ (VCM®)</strong><br> <br> The TLX SOHC V-6 combines Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) with Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (i-VTEC), which changes the lift profile and thus timing and lift duration of the intake valves. A switching mechanism allows the engine to operate with the lift and duration optimized for either low or high-rpm operation. The rear cylinder bank closes all intake and exhaust valves to minimize pumping losses on the cylinders which are still firing, increasing overall engine efficiency.<br> <br> The \"intelligent\" portion of the system is its ability to vary valve operation based on the driving situation and engine rpm. At low rpm, the i-VTEC intake valve timing and lift are optimized (low lift, short duration) for increased torque, which allows a wide range of 3-cylinder operation. As engine rpm builds past 5,000 rpm, the i-VTEC system transitions to a high-lift, long-duration intake cam profile for superior high-rpm engine power.<br> <br> V-6 VCM Operation — To help improve the fuel efficiency of the TLX engine, Acura\'s Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) is used. The system cooperates with Active Control engine Mounts (ACM) to allow the engine to operate with three cylinders in a wide range of situations to maximize fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. When greater power is needed, the system switches seamlessly to 6-cylinder operation.<br> <br> During startup, aggressive acceleration, or steep ascents — any time high power output is required — the engine operates on all six cylinders. During moderate-speed cruising and at low or moderate engine loads, the system operates just the front bank of three cylinders.<br> <br> The VCM system can tailor the working displacement of the engine to match the driving requirements from moment to moment. Since the system automatically closes both the intake and exhaust valves of the cylinders that are not used, pumping losses associated with intake and exhaust are eliminated and fuel efficiency gets a further boost. The system combines maximum performance and maximum fuel efficiency — two characteristics that don\'t typically coexist in conventional engines.<br> <br> VCM deactivates specific cylinders by using the i-VTEC (intelligent Variable Valve-Timing and Lift Electronic Control) system to close the intake and exhaust valves while the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) simultaneously cuts fuel to those cylinders. The spark plugs continue to fire in inactive cylinders to minimize plug temperature loss and prevent fouling induced from incomplete combustion during cylinder re-activation.<br> <br> The system is electronically controlled, and uses special integrated spool valves in the cylinder heads. Based on commands from the system\'s Electronic Control Unit, the spool valves selectively direct oil pressure to the rocker arms for specific cylinders. This oil pressure in turn drives synchronizing pistons that connect and disconnect the rocker arms.<br> <br> The VCM system monitors throttle position, vehicle speed, engine speed, automatic-transmission gear selection and other factors to determine the correct cylinder activation scheme for the operating conditions. In addition, the system determines whether engine oil pressure is suitable for VCM switching and whether catalytic-converter temperature will remain in the proper range. To further smooth the activation or deactivation of cylinders, the system adjusts ignition timing and throttle position and turns the torque converter lock-up on and off to seamlessly transition between three and six cylinder modes.<br> <br> <strong>V-6 SH-AWD Idle Stop System</strong><br> <br> To help improve fuel efficiency, TLX SH-AWD models come equipped with a new Idle Stop capability. When the system is active and certain operating conditions are met, the TLX engine will automatically shut off when the vehicle comes to a stop. When the driver releases the brake pedal after a stop, the engine automatically restarts and the TLX is ready to accelerate.<br> <br> The system is engineered to operate smoothly and seamlessly. When stopped, a special cold storage evaporator in the air conditioning system helps maintain a comfortable cabin temperature even in warm weather. The TLX\'s active engine mounts help smooth the restart. Idle Stop operation is fully integrated into the operation of the TLX\'s Brake Hold system and its available Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low Speed Follow.<br> <br> <strong>V-6 Active Control Engine Mounts and Active Sound Control</strong><br> <br> A powerful 28-volt Active Control Engine Mount system (ACM) is used to minimize the effects of engine vibration as the VCM system switches cylinders on and off. The 28-volt ACM is a key factor in the VCM\'s broad range of operation in the new TLX. Sensors alert the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to direct ACM actuators positioned at the front and rear of the engine to cancel engine vibration using a reverse-phase motion. In the cabin of the TLX, an Active Sound Control (ASC) system further mitigates low frequency noise that can occur during 3-cylinder operation.<br> <br> There are two different Active Sound Control profiles available in the TLX. When the Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) is in the ECON or Normal setting, the ASC is tuned for maximum interior quietness. When the IDS Sport or Sport+ mode is selected, the ASC allows a more aggressive interior engine and exhaust note.<br> <br> <strong>V-6 Long Range Remote Engine Start with Vehicle Feedback</strong><br> <br> The 3.5-liter TLX with Advance Package provides the ability to start the vehicle\'s engine remotely. This enables drivers to start their TLX, thereby activating the climate control system and heated/ventilated seats before they enter the vehicle — perfect for hot or cold days. The remote is designed to have a range of operation of up to about ½ mile. To start the engine remotely, the owner presses the LOCK button on the remote and then holds the ENGINE button for a few seconds. When the engine is started remotely, the wipers, lighting and audio systems remain off, and the security system remains set. The engine will run for up to 10 minutes after remote starting, and then shut off automatically if the owner doesn\'t reach the vehicle within that time. When the owner does get to the TLX within 10 minutes, the engine will keep running while the owner unlocks the vehicle.<br> <br> This system also provides feedback to the owner to confirm whether the engine is running or the vehicle is locked. The remote has three LED indicators: amber, green and red. To confirm engine start, the owner presses the LOCK button and then holds the ENGINE button for a few seconds. The amber indicator will flash while the remote communicates with the vehicle. If the engine is running, the green LED will then light for one second. If the engine is not running, the red indicator will light for one second. To verify whether the vehicle is locked, the owner presses the LOCK button once. After the amber light comes on, either the green or red LED will light for one second to indicate that the vehicle is locked or not, respectively. And if the red LED flashes three times, the vehicle is out of the remote\'s range.<br> <br> This system can provide owners with the comfort of a pre-warmed and de-fogged/defrosted vehicle on a cold winter morning — or a pre-cooled interior on hot days. Plus, it adds the convenience and confidence of knowing that their vehicle is securely locked, even far beyond the range of a typical remote.<br> <br> <strong>Cold-Air Induction System</strong><br> <br> To maximize power output, the TLX has a cold-air intake system that picks up engine induction air from the grille area at the front of the vehicle, which is typically about five percent cooler than the air in the hot engine compartment. Cooler intake air has greater density, which allows the Direct Injection system to add proportionately more fuel for enhanced power output.<br> <br> <strong>Direct Injection System</strong><br> <br> Both 4-cylinder and V-6 TLX engines feature efficient direct injection. The system features a compact, high-pressure, direct-injection pump that allows both high fuel flow and pulsation suppression, while variable pressure control optimizes injector operation. A multi-hole injector delivers fuel directly into each cylinder (not to the intake port, as in conventional port fuel injection designs), allowing for more efficient combustion and greater power output.<br> <br> The multi-hole injectors help create the ideal stoichiometric fuel/air mixture in the cylinders for good emissions control. Theoretically, a stoichiometric mixture has just enough air to completely burn the available fuel. Based on the operating conditions, the direct-injection system alters its function for best performance. Upon cold engine startup, fuel is injected into the cylinders on the compression stroke. This creates a weak stratified charge effect that improves engine start-up and reduces exhaust emissions before a normal operating temperature is reached. For maximum power and fuel efficiency, fuel is injected during the intake stroke once the engine is fully warmed up. This helps create a more homogeneous fuel/air mix in the cylinder. This improves volumetric efficiency, and the cooling effect of the incoming fuel improves anti-knock performance.<br> <br> <strong>Drive-by-Wire™ Throttle System</strong><br> <br> The TLX Drive-by-Wire™ throttle system replaces a conventional throttle cable with smart electronics that \"connect\" the accelerator pedal to a throttle valve inside the throttle-body. The result is less under-hood clutter and lower weight, as well as quicker and more accurate throttle actuation. Plus, a specially programmed \"gain\" rate between the throttle pedal and engine offers improved drivability and optimized engine response to suit specific driving conditions.<br> <br> Acura\'s Drive-by-Wire throttle system establishes the current driving conditions by monitoring throttle pedal position, throttle valve position, engine speed (rpm) and road speed. This information is used to define the throttle control sensitivity that gives the TLX\'s throttle pedal a predictable and responsive feel that meets driver expectations.<br> <br> Three different throttle profiles are available in the TLX. When the Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) is in the ECON mode, the system uses a gradual profile that encourages fuel savings. In Normal mode, the throttle profile balances economy and performance for all-around driving. When the Sport or Sport+ mode is selected, the system switches to a more aggressive throttle map to enhance responsiveness.<br> <br> <strong>Direct Ignition and Detonation/Knock Control</strong><br> <br> The TLX\'s Electronic Control Unit (ECU) monitors engine functions to determine the best ignition spark timing. Engine block-mounted acoustic detonation/knock sensors \"listen\" to the engine, and based on this input, the ECU can retard the ignition timing to prevent potentially damaging detonation. An ignition coil unit for each cylinder is positioned above each spark plug\'s access bore.<br> <br> <strong>Close-Coupled Catalysts</strong><br> <br> The exhaust manifolds of both TLX engines are cast directly into the aluminum cylinder heads to reduce weight, decrease parts count, and create more underhood space. The result of this casting design is that the primary catalytic converters are positioned much closer to the combustion chambers, enabling extremely rapid converter \"light-off\" after engine start. A significant weight savings is realized by eliminating traditional exhaust manifolds.<br> <br> <strong>Emissions Control</strong><br> <br> Both 2015 TLX engines meet the tough EPA Tier 2/Bin 5 and CARB LEV II ULEV emissions standards, and are certified to this level of emissions performance for 120,000 miles. A number of advanced technologies are factors in the emissions performance. The unique cylinder head-mounted close-coupled catalytic converters light off more quickly after engine start up, and a 32-bit RISC microprocessor within the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) boosts computing power to improve the precision of spark and fuel delivery.<br> <br> Both engines feature Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) that continually adjusts the fuel delivery to yield the best combination of power, low fuel consumption and low emissions. Multiple sensors constantly monitor critical engine operating parameters such as intake air temperature, ambient air pressure, throttle position, intake airflow volume, intake manifold pressure, coolant temperature, exhaust-to-air ratios, as well as the position of the crankshaft and the camshafts.<br> <br> <strong>Friction-Reducing Technologies</strong><br> <br> Both TLX engines make use of friction-reducing technologies designed to improve engine efficiency. The outer skirts of lightweight aluminum pistons feature a special coating that reduces overall friction as the pistons move within the cylinder bores. Plateau honing further lowers the friction level between the pistons and the cylinders by creating an ultra-smooth surface. Plateau honing is a 2-stage machining process that uses two grinding processes instead of the more conventional single honing process. This also enhances the long-term wear characteristics of the engine.<br> <br> <strong>One-Touch Start System</strong><br> <br> To ensure consistent starting, the TLX has a one-touch start system that maintains starter engagement until the engine starts. Should the driver release the Start button before the engine starts, the system will start the vehicle. Simply push the Start button (with a foot on the brake pedal and the fob in the vehicle) and the engine will automatically start up.<br> <br> <strong>100,000+/- Mile Tune-up Intervals</strong><br> <br> The TLX\'s engines no scheduled maintenance for 100,000+/- miles or more, other than periodic inspections and normal fluid and filter replacements. The first tune-up includes water pump inspection, valve adjustment, installation of new spark plugs, and in V-6 models, replacement of the camshaft timing belt.<br> <br> <strong>Maintenance Minder™ System</strong><br> <br> To eliminate unnecessary service stops while ensuring that the vehicle is properly maintained, the TLX has a Maintenance Minder™ system that continually monitors the vehicle\'s operating condition. When maintenance is required, the driver is alerted via a message on the Multi-Information Display (MID).<br> <br> The Maintenance Minder™ system monitors operating conditions such as oil and coolant temperature along with engine speed to determine the proper service intervals. Depending on operating conditions, oil change intervals can be extended to a maximum of 10,000 miles, potentially sparing the owner considerable expense and inconvenience over the life of the vehicle. The owner-resettable system monitors all normal service parts and systems, including oil and filter, tire rotation, air-cleaner, automatic transmission fluid, spark plugs, timing belt, coolant, brake pads and more. To mitigate the potential for driver distraction, maintenance alerts are presented on the MID only when the ignition is first turned on, not while driving.<br> <br> <strong>Sequential SportShift 8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT) with Torque Converter</strong><br> <br> To maximize performance and fuel efficiency, the 2.4-liter TLX has a standard 8-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT), the world\'s first transmission of this type to be paired with a torque converter. In the 8-speed DCT, one clutch controls the odd gears while the other clutch controls the even gears. This arrangement allows gear changes with a much smaller interruption in power to the wheels, resulting in millisecond-quick shifts. In addition, the DCT\'s efficient power transmission and wider overall ratio range contribute to the TLX\'s substantial gain in fuel efficiency compared to the outgoing TSX 4-cylinder.<br> <br> Compared to a conventional manual transmission, the operation of the clutches and shifting mechanisms are electronically controlled, eliminating the need for a clutch pedal or manual shift lever. The DCT with its closely spaced ratios, ultra-quick shifts and automatic downshift rev-matching, gives the TLX 4-cylinder an exhilarating and sporty feel. The DCT transmission in the TLX also features a steering wheel-mounted paddle shifter system that lets the driver take manual control of transmission gear selection, further heightening the driving experience.<br> <br> The ultra-thin torque converter complements the efficient operation of the DCT by providing exceptionally smooth operation in stop-and-go situations, plus it offers off-the-line torque multiplication for improved initial acceleration that a DCT alone can\'t equal. In an aggressive standing-start launch, the torque converter substantially improves acceleration in the first 1.4 seconds, or about the first 60 feet (as compared to a DCT alone).<br> <br> <strong>Sequential SportShift 9-Speed Automatic Transmission</strong><br> <br> 2015 TLX V-6 models are equipped with an all-new 9-speed automatic transmission featuring Sequential SportShift. The Sequential SportShift 9-speed automatic is 66 lbs. lighter than the 6-speed automatic in the previous TL, with more closely spaced gear ratios and 25 percent faster gear shifts that enhance performance and fuel efficiency.<br> <br> The console-mounted shift lever is replaced with a fully electronic, shift-by-wire gear selector. Park, Neutral and Drive are selected with the push of a button. Reverse is selected by pulling back a dedicated switch. Indicator lights near the buttons indicate the mode selected. As an added safety feature, if the vehicle is brought to a stop in Drive, the system will automatically select Park if the driver\'s seatbelt is unbuckled and the driver\'s door is opened. A steering wheel-mounted paddle shifter system lets the driver take manual control of transmission gear selection.<br> <br> <strong>Cooperative Transmission Control</strong><br> <br> Both shift performance and smoothness are improved by cooperative control between the Drive-by-Wire throttle system and the two available transmissions. The engine is throttled by the engine management system during upshifts and downshifts; thus the function of the engine and transmission can be closely choreographed for faster, smoother shifting. As a result, the peak g-forces (or \"shift shock\") are reduced significantly during upshifts and downshifts.<br> <br> <strong>Automatic Modes</strong><br> <br> Both TLX transmissions can be operated in two different, fully automatic modes, which are controlled by the Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) switch that is positioned on the center console. In Econ, Normal and Sport IDS modes, the transmission combines fuel efficiency with smooth operation and responsive power when needed. When the IDS is placed in Sport+ mode, the transmission switches to more aggressive mapping that puts the emphasis on performance-oriented driving, with higher engine rpm for greater acceleration and response.<br> <br> <strong>Smart Transmission Logic</strong><br> <br> Both transmissions incorporate an advanced Grade Logic Control System, Shift Hold Control and Cornering G Shift Control — all of which reduce unwanted shifting and gear hunting. The result is smart transmission operation that optimizes fuel efficiency and keeps the transmission in the appropriate gear for driving conditions, generating excellent performance and smooth operation.<br> <br> While ascending or descending hills, Grade Logic Control alters the transmission\'s shift schedule to reduce shift frequency and improve speed control. The transmission ECU continually measures throttle position, vehicle speed and acceleration/deceleration to determine when the vehicle is on a hill. The shift schedule is then adjusted — during ascents to hold the transmission in lower gears to boost climbing power, and during descents to provide greater engine braking.<br> <br> Shift Hold Control keeps the transmission in its current (lower) gear ratio during aggressive driving, as in the case of decelerating at a corner entry. Shift Hold Control leaves the chassis undisturbed by eliminating excess shifting and ensures that power will be immediately available (without a downshift) at the corner exit. Cornering G Shift Control monitors the vehicle lateral acceleration to determine when the TLX is turning. When the system detects sufficient cornering speed, it will suppress any unwanted upshifts. This prevents the transmission from upshifting during a corner, which could upset the chassis balance thus requiring downshifting again at the corner exit when the throttle is applied.<br> <br> <strong>Paddle Shifter Operation in Econ, Normal and Sport Integrated Dynamic System (IDS) Modes</strong><br> <br> While in Econ, Normal or Sport IDS modes, special transmission logic programming allows the use of the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. When the driver operates the paddle shifters, the transmission responds to the driver\'s shift command and then returns to its normal fully automatic mode if further paddle shift inputs are not made within a given time. This special logic makes it easy for the driver to command a quick downshift without leaving the convenience of Drive mode.<br> <br> <strong>Paddle Shifter Operation In Sport+ Mode</strong><br> <br> When the Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) is switched to the Sport+ mode, a pull on the racing-inspired paddle shifters (mounted on the steering wheel) places the transmission in fully manual mode until another mode of operation is selected. A digital display in the instrument cluster indicates which gear the transmission is in.<br> <br> A double-kick-down feature lets the driver command a sport-minded double downshift — such as from Fifth to Third gear. By pulling on the left downshift paddle twice in rapid succession, the transmission will drop directly to the chosen lower gear ratio. The Drive-by-Wire throttle system also creates a \"blip\" of the throttle to help match gear speeds while downshifting.<br> <br> To prevent harm to the powertrain when the transmission is paddle shifted by the driver (including during double-kick-down shifts), the system will inhibit potentially damaging shifts. As an added safety measure, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) can also cut off fuel to the engine to prevent over-revving. If fuel cut-off is insufficient to prevent engine over-revving, as may be possible when the vehicle is on a steep downhill, the transmission will automatically upshift to prevent damage. On downshifts, the transmission will not execute a driver command that will over-rev the engine.<br> <br> <strong>Front Wheel Drive</strong><br> <br> The TLX offers front wheel drive, paired with either a 4-cylinder or V-6 engine. With its efficient and lightweight design, the TLX front wheel drive system makes a significant contribution to overall fuel efficiency.<br> <br> The latest version of Acura\'s Precision All-Wheel Steer™ (P-AWS) is standard on all front-wheel drive TLX models, and helps give the TLX best-in-class dynamic performance at all speeds.<br> <br> The system is complemented by Agile Handling Assist, which employs the anti-lock brake system to individually brake either the left or right rear wheel to reduce yaw delay (the period between steering wheel input and the rotation of the body) to improve corner traceability and balance.<br> <br> <strong>Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®)</strong><br> <br> The TLX SH-AWD features a new hydraulically controlled iteration of Acura\'s acclaimed Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®), which progressively distributes optimum torque not only between the front and rear axles, but also between the left and right rear wheels. Like its P-AWS counterpart, the TLX SH-AWD system is complemented by Agile Handling Assist.<br> <br> The benefits of the SH-AWD system are superior all-weather handling and neutral, accurate steering under power that is unmatched by front-drive, rear-drive or conventional all-wheel-drive systems.<br> <br> By rotating the outside rear wheel faster than the front axle while cornering, SH-AWD uses torque vectoring to create a yaw moment to help turn the vehicle through the corner — reducing understeer and improving controllability. With cornering forces more evenly distributed between front and rear tires, overall cornering power is increased — on wet or dry roads.<br> <br> Vehicles with high power ratings using conventional front or rear drive systems often employ a limited-slip differential to help maintain traction when under power. By linking inside and outside drive wheels, these systems tend to resist turning and can increase understeer. Conventional AWD systems similarly work to link the inboard and outboard tires as well as the front and rear axles, which can create resistance to turning. Using torque vectoring to help turn the vehicle, SH-AWD delivers more responsive, neutral and predictable handling performance while providing outstanding all-weather traction and control.<br> <br> Controls and Parameters — The SH-AWD system works in cooperation with the TLX\'s Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) system and Agile Handling Assist to optimize torque distribution for superior handling and traction utilization. The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) provides information on engine torque, airflow and transmission gear-ratio selection, while the VSA ECU provides wheel-speed data. The SH-AWD ECU also monitors steering angle, steering angle rate of change, lateral G-forces, vehicle yaw rate and hydraulic clutch pressure for the right and left rear axle shafts. Drive torque is calculated from ECU information, and then the acceleration situation, wheel spin, lateral G-force, steering angle and steering angle rate-of-change are used to determine the front-to-rear torque distribution and the torque split between right and left rear wheels.<br> <br> <strong>Safety and Driver Asistive Technologies</strong><br> <br> A vehicle\'s safety performance starts with its dynamic capabilities. Acura engineers targeted a high level of predictability, precision and stability in the TLX\'s steering, braking and emergency handling capabilities. In the event of a collision, the many integrated active and passive safety features help to mitigate the potential for injury. These features include the newest generation of Acura\'s Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure and a new one-piece, high-strength steel door stiffener ring, along with advanced airbag and seatbelt restraint systems. Acura engineers also targeted the highest available safety ratings from the National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).<br> <br> Further, the TLX can be equipped with a host of AcuraWatch™ driver-assistive technologies that help to improve the driver\'s situational awareness and, in certain circumstances, intervene to help avoid a collision or mitigate its severity. For the 2015 Acura TLX, this includes two available new systems — Rear Cross Traffic Monitor and Road Departure Mitigation (RDM) — both being applied for the first time within the Acura lineup.<br> <br> <strong>Next-Generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) Body Structure</strong><br> <br> The TLX utilizes the latest version of Acura\'s Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body-structure to enhance occupant protection and crash compatibility in frontal collisions. The ACE body structure uses a network of interconnected structural elements — now using an even greater amount of high-tensile steel — to absorb and distribute crash energy away from the passenger compartment. The enhanced frontal crash energy management can also help to more evenly disperse the forces transferred to other vehicles in a crash. Additionally, ACE helps minimize the potential for under-ride or over-ride situations that can happen during frontal impacts with a larger or smaller vehicle.<br> <br> <strong>Collision Safety Targets</strong><br> <br> Based on internal testing, the new ACE body design is expected to help the TLX achieve the highest available crash safety ratings. In federal National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) testing, the TLX is anticipated to achieve a 5-Star Overall Vehicle Score. In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) testing, the TLX is anticipated to achieve a GOOD rating in all categories, including the extremely rigorous new IIHS small overlap front crash test, which involves 25-percent of a car\'s front end on the driver\'s side striking a 5-foot-tall rigid barrier at 40 mph. The new TLX is also anticipated to achieve the TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating based on these GOOD ratings along with available Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS) and Forward Collision Warning (FCW), essential features for meeting the IIHS autonomous crash-avoidance capability.<br> <br> <strong>Crash Energy \"Pathways\"</strong><br> <br> Unlike most conventional designs that direct frontal crash energy only to the lower load-bearing structures in the front end, the next-generation ACE body actively channels frontal crash energy to both upper and lower structural elements, including the floor frame rails, side sills and A-pillars. By creating specifically engineered \"pathways\" that help distribute these frontal impact forces through a greater percentage of the vehicle\'s total structure, the ACE body can more effectively route crash energy around and away from the passenger compartment to help limit cabin deformation and further improve occupant protection.<br> <br> <strong>Structural Safety Improvements</strong><br> <br> Meeting the TLX\'s top crash-safety rating targets required numerous structural engineering advancements. Details include:<br> <br> Frontal — The next-generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering (ACE) body structure is projected to help the TLX pass the most stringent latest IIHS Small Overlap Front Crash Test with a highest available result of GOOD.<br> Side — The use of sophisticated advances in collision-load pathways and the use of hot-stamped high-strength steel — including a one-piece door opening stiffener ring — helps improve occupant protection in side impact collisions.<br> Rear — Rear-impact performance meeting the federal FMVSS301 standard is achieved by sophisticated engineering design and specifications, and the strategic use of lightweight high-strength steel.<br> Rollover/Roof Strength — The TLX achieves the federal FMVSS216a standard and anticipated IIHS Roof Strength GOOD test rating by adopting hot-stamped high-strength steel and optimized engineering specifications.<br> IIHS Small Overlap Front (Narrow Offset Barrier) — The ACE structure integrated into the TLX is expected to aid in the compliance with the latest rigorous IIHS Small Overlap Front Barrier test.<br> <br> <strong>Hot-Stamped Stiffener Ring</strong><br> <br> The 2015 TLX uses a new hot-stamped stiffener ring around the door opening. There are three major advantages of this construction method: (1) The one-piece door-opening ring has no joints, so crash loads are transferred more efficiently; (2) the single-piece construction improves the fit and finish of the door opening; and (3) weight is reduce by 9.0 pounds compared to a conventional multi-part ring.<br> <br> To form the ring, a single steel blank is loaded into an oven and heated to 940º Centigrade and then formed and quenched in a single stamping and tempering process. This same technology has been applied to the 2014 Acura MDX.<br> <br> <strong>Airbag System</strong><br> <br> The TLX is equipped with seven airbags, including dual-stage, multiple-threshold front airbags, front side airbags, side-curtain airbags with rollover sensors, and a new driver\'s side knee airbag.<br> <br> Driver\'s Side Knee Airbag — The driver\'s knee airbag is designed to better position the driver in the event of a frontal collision, to take greater advantage of the protection provided by the front airbag and seatbelt. The knee airbag is contained beneath a panel on the underside of the instrument panel. For improved knee clearance, the panel is contoured away from the driver\'s knees.<br> <br> Dual-Stage, Multiple-Threshold Front Airbags (SRS) — Every TLX is equipped with dual-stage, multiple-threshold front airbags (SRS). If deployed, the airbags are capable of being inflated at different rates depending on crash severity, seat-belt usage and other factors. Front airbags are designed to supplement the seat belts to help reduce the likelihood of head and upper body injuries in frontal crashes.<br> <br> Front Passenger Airbag-Off Indicator — An indicator light marked \"PASS AIRBAG,\" located on the right of the upper display, illuminates to indicate that the passenger\'s front airbag is off and will not deploy during a frontal impact. This happens when the weight of the front-seat passenger, or an object on the seat, is 63.8 pounds or less.<br> <br> Driver and Front Passenger Side Airbags — Driver and front passenger SmartVent™ side airbags mounted in the outboard area of each front seatback are designed to help provide pelvis and thorax protection in the event of a severe side impact and also allows the side airbags to inflate with a low risk of injuring an out of position occupant. This eliminates the need for the previous-generation TL\'s Occupant Position Detection System (OPDS).<br> <br> Side Curtain Airbags with Rollover Sensor — All outboard seating positions include a side curtain airbag system. In the event of a sufficient side impact or rollover, the side curtain airbags deploy from the ceiling, providing a significant level of head protection in the window area. Compared to previous systems, the TLX\'s new side curtain airbags have a wider deployment profile, and remain fully deployed for an extended time to further mitigate the possibility of an occupant being ejected from the vehicle.<br> <br> <strong>E-Pretensioner Front Seatbelts</strong><br> <br> Another new TLX safety feature on models with the Advance Package is a driver and front-passenger seatbelt e-pretensioner system. During normal driving conditions, the e-pretensioner system provides a reduced tension seatbelt experience, enhancing driving comfort. During sporty or aggressive driving, based on speed, yaw rate and lateral G, the system uses motors to subtly tighten the seatbelt and firmly hold the driver and front-seat passenger in their seat.<br> <br> In addition, the e-pretensioner system tightens and holds the seatbelts during sudden steering inputs like those that may occur during an emergency maneuver, skid or minor collision. The e-pretensioner system is fully automatic and requires no intervention from the driver or front passenger, aside from the initial fastening of the seatbelt.<br> <br> The front passenger seatbelt e-pretensioner system included in the TLX\'s Advance Package is supplementary to the load-limiting seatbelt retractors with pyrotechnic pretensioners that are featured on all TLX models.<br> <br> <strong>Adjustable Head Restraints</strong><br> <br> All five front and rear seating positions feature individually adjustable head restraints, all of which are FMVSS 202a compliant. Compared to the Active Head Restraints in the previous TL model, the 2015 TLX\'s front head restraints feature the latest generation of neck protection performance and are lighter and less complex than previous Active Head Restraints.<br> <br> The previous TL\'s rear head restraint folding feature is eliminated, reducing complexity and weight without compromising safety or comfort.<br> <br> <strong>Child Safety Features</strong><br> <br> Two Lower Anchors and Tethers for CHildren (LATCH) child seat-mounting positions are built into the outboard rear seats. The LATCH system utilizes both an upper child-seat tether anchor and dedicated lower-anchor points that are built into the body of the vehicle. These help ensure correct mounting of a compatible child seat. A third upper tether is located in the rear center position. The TLX also features childproof rear door locks. When engaged, they permit the rear doors to be opened only from the outside, thereby helping to prevent accidental opening by a child.<br> <br> <strong>Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low-Speed Follow (LSF)</strong><br> <br> Included in the TLX\'s Advance Package, Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) allows the driver to set a desired speed and distance interval behind the vehicle ahead, allowing the use of cruise control in light traffic conditions. This significantly reduces the driver stress of driving in traffic. The system uses the Millimeter Wave Radar and a Monocular Camera to continually track the distance to the vehicle ahead, and then adjusts the TLX\'s speed to maintain a safe distance interval. A short, medium, long, or extra long interval can be selected. When required, the TLX autonomously brakes using the Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) modulator.<br> <br> Integrated Low-Speed Follow (LSF), which uses the same Millimeter Wave Radar, Monocular Camera, and VSA modulator, extends the automatic following capability to stop-and-go traffic situations (down to 0 mph). ACC with LSF functions include the following:<br> <br> A preceding vehicle is detected ­in the lane ahead — Decelerates automatically, if required, and then controls the following distance.<br> The preceding vehicle stops — Stops automatically and remains stationary.<br> The preceding vehicle accelerates from a stop — Resumes following when the SET or RES switch or accelerator pedal is operated.<br> Another vehicle merges in between the TLX and the preceding vehicle — Automatically switches \"targets\" to the nearest preceding vehicle.<br> The preceding vehicle exits the lane — ACC with LSF system continues at cruise-control speed previously selected by driver (25 to 90 mph).<br> <br> A Multi Information Display (MID) message and audible warning alert the driver when either ACC or LSF functions are activated.<br> <br> <strong>Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS)</strong><br> <br> Included in the TLX with Advance Package, Acura\'s newest version of its Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS™) is one of the most sophisticated driver-assistive technologies available. It continually scans traffic conditions ahead of the TLX, alerts the driver of a potential collision, and then takes emergency autonomous braking action to help reduce the severity of a collision if drivers don\'t take corrective action on their own.<br> <br> When CMBS detects a potential collision, visual, audible and tactile (driver seatbelt e-pretensioning) alerts prompt the driver to take corrective actions. The visual alerts appear on the Multi-Information Display (MID), with another visual warning on the windshield via the head-up warning display. If the system determines that a collision is imminent, it applies the brakes to help reduce vehicle speed and eventual collision forces.<br> <br> Further distinguishing the new TLX, its CMBS also recognizes shapes, and can differentiate between a vehicle and a pedestrian, warning the driver in each case. A Millimeter Wave Radar unit located behind the front grille and a Monocular Camera mounted at the upper portion of the windshield is used to detect vehicles and pedestrians. The radar unit and camera work simultaneously and cooperatively to control the VSA modulator, which provides any required braking. This \"fusion\" of radar and camera allows the system to more quickly determine a potential collision, significantly increasing the likelihood of bringing the car to a complete stop and avoiding impact.<br> <br> It is important to note that CMBS cannot detect all objects ahead, nor is it intended to replace the driver\'s assessment of traffic conditions and control of the vehicle. The driver must intervene in certain situations, and must always be attentive when using the system. Although in many cases CMBS will stop the car, it is not intended to apply enough braking force to prevent all collisions. Based on the conditions, the system also may not perform all visual-, audible- and tactile-alert stages, and may instead automatically engage the brakes if the system deems it necessary.<br> <br> <strong>Forward Collision Warning (FCW)</strong><br> <br> Included in models with the Technology Package or Advance Package, Forward Collision Warning (FCW) uses a camera mounted in the upper portion of the windshield to detect vehicles and pedestrians ahead and to determine whether a collision is imminent. If the FCW system detects a vehicle or pedestrian in front of the TLX and then determines that a collision may occur (due to a speed differential between the TLX and the object), it will trigger a \"BRAKE\" message on the Multi-Information Display (MID) and an audible alert. The FCW system in the TLX with Technology Package will not automatically brake, and the driver remains responsible for safely operating the vehicle and avoiding collisions.<br> <br> Drivers may adjust the distance at which FCW alerts occur and may choose between \"Long,\" \"Normal,\" or \"Short.\" Drivers may also select \"Off\" to disable the FCW system entirely.<br> <br> Note that the FCW system cannot detect all objects ahead; accuracy will vary based on weather, speed and other factors.<br> <br> <strong>Lane Departure Warning (LDW)</strong><br> <br> Included in the Technology Package and Advance Package, Lane Departure Warning (LDW) is designed to alert the driver if the vehicle is leaving a detected lane without the turn signal being activated. The system functions at speeds from 45 to 90 mph on straight or slightly curved roads, alerting the driver of deviations from a detected road.<br> <br> In TLX models equipped with the Technology Package or Advanced Package, the same upper front windshield camera is used for LDW, FCW, and LKAS.<br> <br> If the vehicle begins to move out of a detected lane without the turn signal activated, LDW illuminates a Lane Departure message on the Multi-Information Display (MID) and sounds an audible warning, advising the driver to take appropriate action. With the Advance package, the driver may select rapid steering wheel vibration (haptic feedback) instead of the audible warning. In either case, the system can be activated and deactivated by pressing the LDW button located on the instrument panel, to the left of the steering column.<br> <br> There are certain conditions under which the system may not engage or operate, including inclement weather (e.g., snow, ice or heavy rain) and extreme cabin heat conditions (due to operability of the camera). It will automatically suspend operation when the brakes are applied or the turn signals are used. LDW may not detect all lane markings or lane departures; accuracy will vary based on weather, speed and road condition. The driver remains responsible for safely operating the vehicle.<br> <br> <strong>Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS)</strong><br> <br> Included in Technology Package and Advance Package, the Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) provides a less stressful driving experience by reducing steering correction movements and driving effort on the highway. LKAS uses a camera to read lane markings and uses EPS to assist the driver in keeping in the middle of the lane.<br> <br> Designed for the U.S. road structure, the system uses a Monocular Camera mounted on the upper portion of the windshield to identify painted lanes, Botts\' Dots and Cat Eye markers at speeds between 45 mph and 90 mph. When LKAS senses that the driver is drifting from the middle of a detected lane, the system generates corrective steering torque to assist the driver in maintaining lane position.<br> <br> <strong>Road Departure Mitigation (RDM)</strong><br> <br> Included in the Advance Package, Road Departure Mitigation (RDM) is a new technology for Acura. RDM uses a Monocular Camera (mounted on the upper portion of the windshield) to identify solid or dashed painted lane lines, Botts\' Dots and Cat Eye markers. RDM uses both steering force, via EPS, and braking force, via VSA, to help the TLX stay in its lane.<br> <br> The monocular camera recognizes lane features and identifies the lane. If the RDM system detects that the TLX is about to leave the detected lane, it will provide steering assist (primary) and in rare occasions when steering is not sufficient, braking assist, to help the driver stay on the road. Only lane departure is activated if the driver is passing over a dashed line, bott\'s dots or cat eye, while deceleration support is disabled. In this case, TLX uses active steering force to return to the lane. RDM is integrated with the Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) system to provide moderate braking, and with the Electric Power Steering (EPS) system to provide steering input.<br> <br> Multiple visual and audible warnings alert the driver when the RDM system is taking corrective action. These include a lane departure warning on the driver\'s Multi Information Display (MID) along with an audible warning.<br> <br> RDM also has a customizable initial warning of either a steering wheel shake/vibration, or an audible alert. This can be customized in the vehicle settings.<br> <br> <strong>Blind Spot Information (BSI)</strong><br> <br> Included in the Technology Package and Advance Package, the Blind Spot Information (BSI) system uses two radar sensors to continually monitor conditions behind the TLX and alert the driver if another vehicle is detected in close proximity — especially in the blind spot of the driver. The BSI system uses the LED indicators (mounted on the A-pillar) and an audible warning to alert the driver.<br> <br> There are two warning levels:<br> <br> If a vehicle is detected in the driver\'s blind spot then the LED indicator on the incoming side illuminates<br> If a vehicle is detected and the TLX turn signal is activated, the LED indicator on the incoming side blinks and a buzzer sounds three times<br> <br> To prevent false alarms while maneuvering at low speed, the BSI system is disabled below approximately 20 mph.<br> <br> <strong>Rear Cross Traffic Monitor</strong><br> <br> Included in the Technology Package and Advance Package, the new Rear Cross Traffic Monitor is a first for the Acura Division. Rear Cross Traffic Monitor works in conjunction with the TLX\'s BSI radar sensors to enhance driver confidence and safety when backing up. The system is especially useful when reversing in congested parking lots with an obstructed view from driver\'s seat.<br> <br> The system utilizes a pair of blind-spot radar units located in the rear bumper corners. When Reverse is selected and an approaching vehicle is detected, arrows indicating the approaching vehicles direction are shown on the 8-inch center display\'s rear camera image. Simultaneously, an audible warning is emitted if cross-traffic is approaching from either side.<br> <br> <strong>Pedestrian Injury Mitigation</strong><br> <br> The TLX has an impact-absorbing front body design to help reduce injury in the event of a frontal collision with a pedestrian. Research shows that the following features can dramatically improve a pedestrian\'s chance of survival if struck by a moving vehicle:<br> <br> Impact-energy absorbing hood — Space is provided between the underside of the hood and key powertrain components, allowing the hood to bend and deform if contact is made with either an adult or a child pedestrian.<br> Energy-absorbing fender mounts and supports — Front fender mounts and brackets are designed to deform easily to help absorb impact energy.<br> Deformable windshield wiper pivots — Wiper pivots are designed to deform and break away easily.<br>','[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_104.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_105.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_106.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_107.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_108.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_109.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_110.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_111.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_112.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_113.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_114.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_115.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_116.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_117.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_118.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_119.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_120.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_121.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_122.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_123.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_124.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_125.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_126.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_127.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_128.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_129.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_130.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/acura-tlx-2015-5368_131.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_4.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_5.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_6.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_7.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_8.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_9.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_10.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_11.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_12.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_13.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_14.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_15.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_16.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_90.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_91.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_92.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_93.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_94.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_95.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_96.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_97.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_98.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_99.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_100.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_101.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-TLX-5368_102.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.

This is the first Acura production car to feature \"Earth Dreams Technology,\" which is comprised of a next-generation set of technological advancements to the engine, which greatly enhance both driving performance and fuel efficiency.<br> <br> Rated at 310 horsepower and 272 lb.-ft. of torque (SAE net), the V-6 powerplant in the Acura RLX develops an additional 10 horsepower and 1 lb.-ft. of torque compared to the 3.7-liter engine equipped in the RL. For exceptional drivability, the RLX\'s new 3.5-liter engine produces in excess of 90 percent of its peak torque over a very broad range of engine speeds, from 2,000 rpm to 6,600 rpm.<br> <br> In spite of the peak horsepower increase, the new engine has impressive EPA- fuel economy ratings for a luxury sedan, with ratings of 20 mpg in the city and 31 mpg on the highway. The 3.5-liter engine meets the stringent ULEV-2 California Air Resources Board (CARB) emissions rating.<br> <br> <strong>BODY</strong><br> <br> The 2014 RLX is larger than the previous RL model in several key exterior dimensions, including width, wheelbase, and front and rear track. The wheelbase, at 112.2 inches, is two inches longer than the previous RL model, providing more rear passenger room and improving the ride quality in the process. At 74.4 inches wide, the Acura RLX is also a substantial 1.7 inches wider than the previous RL model.<br> <br> Static and dynamic rigidity and rear lateral stiffness are significantly improved. To increase stiffness and rigidity in key areas without increasing weight, 55 percent of the RLX body in white is made from high-strength steel. Hot-stamped high-strength steel is used in key areas for enhanced safety collision performance, with the added benefit of anticipated high scores in narrow offset, side impact, and roof strength tests. Extensive use of aluminum body components in key areas saves 76.1 pounds compared to traditional all-steel construction.<br> <br> The 2014 Acura RLX features the world\'s first Jewel Eye™ LED headlights, which offer outstanding light distribution and excellent down-the-road illumination performance and light characteristics. The RLX taillights utilize periphery LED illumination that is both effective and highly distinctive.<br> <br> <strong>CHASSIS</strong><br> <br> The standard Precision All-Wheel Steer (P-AWS) system on the RLX continuously monitors and calculates the correct amount of independent rear-wheel steering (toe angle) necessary for driving conditions. As the industry\'s first left/right independent rear-wheel toe angle control system, P-AWS uses an all-electric system that enhances driving dynamics.<br> <br> In front, the Acura RLX\'s new double-wishbone, lower double-joint front suspension with Amplitude Reactive Dampers significantly improves handling agility, driver confidence and security, and ride sophistication. In back, the RLX\'s multi-link rear suspension is optimized for a flat ride during cornering, confident turning capability, and a smooth ride in a variety of urban, highway and open road scenarios.<br> <br> Available Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) allows the driver to set a desired speed and a distance interval behind a vehicle detected ahead, allowing the use of cruise control in light traffic. This system is combined with a new Low-Speed Follow capability, which extends the automatic following capability when traffic slows below the set speed. If the vehicle detected ahead is in range of the system and comes to a stop, the RLX will also come to a stop. When the vehicle ahead moves forward, the vehicle icon on the multi-information display will start to blink. With a press of a steering wheel-mounted button or a press of the accelerator pedal, the Acura RLX will resume the prior set speed.<br> <br> The RLX\'s high-efficiency Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) enhances vehicle stability when cornering. If vehicle understeer or oversteer is detected, the system selectively reduces power and/or brakes individual wheels to help correct the condition and stabilize the vehicle.<br> <br> Finally, the available Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) scans the road ahead to actively assist the driver in driving in the middle of a detected lane.<br> <br> The RLX and RLX with Navigation grades feature 7-spoke 18x8J noise-reducing alloy wheels while the Technology, Krell Audio and Advance grades feature larger 19x8J noise-reducing alloy wheels. The special noise-reducing design lowers tire noise by 7-decibels across the audible frequency range.<br> <br> INTERIOR<br> <br> The 2014 RLX interior is an all-new design that combines welcoming five-passenger comfort with by far the most luxury and technology ever offered in an Acura. High-end premium elements like a carefully stitched leather instrument panel cover, soft-touch materials, premium finishes and rich wood-grain accents combine with an intuitive new control layout to create a distinctive environment in tune with this luxury performance sedan\'s clearly defined sporting character.<br> <br> Passenger space has increased in key dimensions compared to the 2012 RL, with more shoulder room front and rear.

Acura is again raising the bar with the introduction of the Acura RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD™, the most powerful and technologically advanced Acura sedan yet and the first to apply Acura\'s groundbreaking new three-motor Sport Hybrid system with electric SH-AWD (Sport Hybrid SH-AWD).</strong><br> <br> With a direct-injected V-6 engine and an all-new 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) with built-in motor-generator powering the front wheels, and two rear electric motors powering the rear wheels, the 377-horsepower RLX combines V8-like performance and 4-cylinder-like fuel efficiency along with exhilarating \"on the rails\" handling performance, courtesy of its electrically-powered torque-vectoring all-wheel drive system.<br> <br> The Acura RLX Sport Hybrid further elevates Acura\'s commitment to create \"the synergy between man and machine\" -vehicles that truly respond to the will of the driver - and deliver new levels of technology-enhanced performance, comfort and convenience. Like the RLX with P-AWS™, the RLX Sport Hybrid delivers class-leading interior space and comfort and a host of signature Acura technologies, including Jewel Eye™ LED headlights, Lane Keeping Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow, and the next generation AcuraLink® connected car system. In addition, the RLX Sport Hybrid applies new Acura technologies including:<br> <br> <ul>     <li>Head-Up Display - this first-ever Acura head-up display projects key information at a glance on the lower portion of the windshield directly in front of the driver. Display modes include SH-AWD system operation, tachometer, turn-by-turn navigation, compass, ACC/LKAS along with vehicle speed.</li>     <li>Electronic Gear Selector - the RLX also is the first Acura to feature Acura\'s new fully electronic push-button gear selector, eliminating the conventional shift-lever and allowing the driver to select drive mode (Drive, Neutral, Park) at the push of a button. In addition, the system will automatically engage the Electronic Parking Brake when the driver selects park and unbuckles his/her seatbelt.</li>     <li>Reactive Force Pedal - in place if a conventional spring mechanism providing force against the driver\'s push on the gas pedal, the RLX Sport Hybrid utilizes an electric mechanism that dynamically varies pedal force to assist the driver in applying the optimum amount of engine power in any driving condition. For example, when climbing a snowy hill, the Reactive Force Pedal will increase pedal force to discourage the driver from applying too much engine torque that may lead to unwanted tire slip.</li> </ul> <br> Using smart packaging, advanced aerodynamic design and lightweight body construction, along with fuel-saving hybrid powertrain technology, the RLX Sport Hybrid has the most spacious five-passenger seating in its class along with a top-class EPA fuel-economy rating of 28/32/30 mpg (city/highway/combined).<br> <br> With a longer wheelbase and wider greenhouse than competing mid-luxury sedans, the new Acura RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD delivers full-size interior space in a nimbler, mid-size luxury sedan package. The RLX boasts the longest rear-seat legroom (38.8 inches), and best front (59.6 inches) and rear (57.0 inches) shoulder room in the mid-luxury class. The RLX advanced body design makes extensive use of high-strength steel and aluminum, further aiding its outstanding fuel efficiency, straight-line performance, and superior handling agility.<br> <br> The new RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD offers an incredible array of advanced safety, driver-assistive and information and media technologies, including the standard next-generation AcuraLink™ connected car system and Multi-Angle Rearview Camera; along with available Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS), Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow and Blind Spot Information (BSI) system. Safety systems available on the RLX Sport Hybrid include technologies such as Collision Mitigation Brake System (CMBS), Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW).<br> <br> Utilizing Acura\'s next-generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure, along with seven airbags (including a driver\'s knee airbag), the RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD is anticipated to earn top-level safety ratings, including a 5-star NCAP Overall Vehicle Score and an IIHS \"TOP SAFETY PICK+\" rating, including a GOOD rating in the IIHS small overlap front crash test.<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid also offers intuitive technology that reduces stress and simplifies the driving and ownership experience - with features such as Electronic Parking Brake with Automatic Brake Hold, a capless refueling system, Smart Entry/Smart Start keyless access system, easy-to-use and customize dual touch screens, \"tensionless\" e-pretension front seatbelts, and available rain-sensing windshield wipers, among others.<br> <br> <strong>THE SYNERGY BETWEEN MAN AND MACHINE</strong><br> <br> As the foundation of Acura\'s product direction, the Synergy Between Man and Machine is the intelligent pairing of useful technologies and luxury features with the idea of creating vehicles that truly respond to the will of the driver. The focus is not on one specific technology, but on the driving experience Acura vehicles provide to the customer. From its sophisticated exterior and interior design, to its balance of performance, low emission and the top-class fuel economy ratings, and advanced and intuitive technology, the RLX Sport Hybrid is designed to exceed the expectations of Acura clients.<br> <br> <strong>MARKET POSITIONING</strong><br> <br> The Acura RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD enters the mid-luxury segment competing against hybrid and/or all-wheel-drive versions of Audi A6, BMW 5-Series, Infiniti Q50, Lexus GS, and Mercedes-Benz E-Class. The RLX is equipped to meet these established competitors, thanks to improvements in virtually every area of its design, performance, technology, luxury and safety features.<br> <br> <strong>POWERTRAIN</strong><br> <br> The 2014 RLX Sport Hybrid\'s all-new three-motor hybrid powertrain combines the power of a conventional V-8 engine with 4-cylinder-like fuel efficiency and the performance-enhancing capabilities of torque-vectoring all-wheel drive.<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid shares it basic engine architecture with the two-wheel-drive RLX with P-AWS. The 3.5-liter, 310-horsepower, 24-valve direct-injected SOHC V-6 engine with i-VTEC® and VCM™ adds an idle-stop feature to further maximize fuel efficiency, and revised cam timing to smooth engine restart after idle stop. Peak torque to the front wheels is rated at 273 lb.-ft. at 4,700 rpm (versus 272 lb.-ft. at 4,500 rpm in the RLX with P-AWS).<br> <br> An all-new advanced 7-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) is standard on the Sport Hybrid—a first for Acura. Unlike a conventional automatic transmission, the DCT offers ultra-quick gear changes and eliminates the need for a torque converter, which significantly improves efficiency. It can operate in fully automatic mode, or can be shifted manually via steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters.<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD uses three electric motors: a single 35-kilowatt (47 hp) motor that is integrated with the 7-speed Dual Clutch Transmission supplements the V-6 engine in driving the front wheels, and a rear-mounted Twin Motor Unit (TMU) containing two 27-kilowatt (36 hp) motors that dynamically distribute electric-motor torque to the rear wheels. Both the front and rear motors capture kinetic energy during vehicle deceleration and braking and convert it to electricity to supply the Intelligent Power Unit\'s 72-cell, 1.3-kWh lithium-ion battery pack, located behind the rear seatback. Together, the 310-horsepower V-6 engine and three electric motors produce a total system output of 377 horsepower and 377 lb.-ft. of torque—the most ever in a production Acura.<br> <br> The front motor is integrated with the 7-speed DCT and is connected to the driveshaft via a clutch. The motor accomplishes three tasks: (1) It supplements the V-6 engine in driving the front wheels when additional power is required, such as in a passing situation; (2) provides regenerative braking to the front wheels; (3) converts engine power to electricity to supplement regenerative braking in recharging the lithium-ion batteries.<br> <br> Acura\'s mechanically-based Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) made its debut on the RL luxury sedan in 2005, and has since been used on a range of Acura models in several iterations. In the RLX Sport Hybrid, SH-AWD operates independent of the gasoline engine. Drawing power from the lithium-ion battery pack, the Twin Motor Unit\'s two electric motors deliver torque directly to the rear wheels, thereby eliminating the weight and energy losses associated with a conventional driveshaft and differential mechanism.<br> <br> When cornering, the RLX Sport Hybrid delivers more torque to the outside rear wheel, much like mechanical SH-AWD, but with more available torque at low engine speeds. Sport Hybrid SH-AWD can also simultaneously apply brake torque to the inside rear wheel during cornering to further enhance cornering control. In addition, since it doesn\'t rely on engine torque, electric SH-AWD can create a larger torque difference between the left and right rear wheels, even during small throttle applications, at low engine speeds or even during deceleration (such as when lifting throttle mid-corner). This substantially magnifies the positive handling benefits of SH-AWD across a much wider range of driving conditions.<br> <br> Engine Architecture<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid 3.5-liter VTEC® V-6 has a smooth-firing 60-degree V-angle and compact overall dimensions. The V-6 has a die-cast lightweight aluminum alloy block with cast-in-place iron cylinder liners. The first ever application of direct injection in an Acura vehicle combines with i-VTEC and Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) to give the RLX a potent blend of power and fuel efficiency.<br> <br> The aluminum-alloy 24-valve engine produces 310 horsepower at 6,500 and generates 273 lb.-ft. of torque at 4,700 rpm. Torque is markedly improved vs. RL in the lower ranges, where the engine typically operates. Along with the increased horsepower, the updated V-6 also contributes to increased fuel efficiency, due in part to internal friction reduction features, including an oil-ring ion-plating treatment, and plateau honing. A new tumble-type intake port design improves combustion efficiency.<br> <br> Engine Block and Crankshaft<br> <br> With its 60-degree V-angle, the V-6 engine is inherently smooth and has compact overall dimensions that allow efficient packaging within the vehicle. The V-6 has a die-cast lightweight aluminum alloy block with cast-in-place iron cylinder liners. Made with a centrifugal spin-casting process, the thin-wall liners are high in strength and low in porosity. The block incorporates a deep-skirt design with four bolts per bearing cap for rigid crankshaft support and minimized noise and vibration. The 3.5L V-6 uses a high-strength steel crankshaft for minimum weight.<br> <br> A new cooling control spacer positioned in the water jacket surrounding the cylinders helps to maintain consistent operating temperature. Plateau honing of the cylinder lining further lowers the friction level between the pistons and the cylinders by creating an ultra-smooth surface. This two-stage machining process uses two grinding processes instead of the more conventional single honing process. Plateau honing also enhances the long-term wear characteristics of the engine.<br> <br> Pistons/Connecting Rods<br> <br> Designed with special \"cavity-shaped\" crowns, the pistons help maintain stable combustion and contribute to stratified-charge combustion. Ion-plated piston rings help reduce friction for greater operating efficiency. The compression ratio is 11.5:1. Heavy-duty steel connecting rods are forged in one piece and then the crankshaft connecting rods are \"crack separated\" to create a lighter and stronger rod with an optimally fitted bearing cap.<br> <br> Cylinder Heads/ Valvetrain<br> <br> Like other Acura V-6 powerplants, the RLX Sport Hybrid engine\'s 4-valve cylinder heads are a single-overhead-camshaft design, with the cams driven by the crankshaft via an automatically tensioned toothed belt. Made of low-pressure cast, low-porosity aluminum, each cylinder head incorporates a new \"tumble port\" design that improves combustion efficiency by creating a more homogeneous fuel-air mixture. An integrated exhaust manifold cast into each cylinder head reduces parts count, saves weight, improves flow and optimizes the location of the close-coupled catalyst.<br> <br> i-VTEC Valve Control System<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid V-6 engine combines Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) with Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC), which changes the lift profile, timing and lift duration of the intake valves. A switching mechanism allows each cylinder to operate with low-rpm valve lift and duration or high-rpm lift and duration. The rear cylinder bank\'s valve gear can also leave all intake and exhaust valves closed to maximize fuel efficiency during cylinder deactivation.<br> <br> The \"intelligent\" portion of the system is its ability to vary valve operation based on the driving situation and engine rpm. At low rpm, the VTEC intake valve timing and lift are optimized (low lift, short duration) for increased torque, which allows a wide range of 3-cylinder operation. As engine rpm builds past 5,000 rpm, the VTEC system transitions to a high-lift, long-duration intake cam profile for superior high-rpm engine power.<br> <br> Variable Cylinder Management ™ (VCM™)<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid engine employs Acura\'s Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) cylinder deactivation technology. The VTEC system combines with Active Control engine Mounts (ACM) to allow the VCM system to operate with three cylinders in a wide range of situations to maximize fuel efficiency and lower emissions. When greater power is needed, the system switches seamlessly to 6-cylinder operation. With the strong power output of the Direct Injection RLX engine, a 4-cylinder operating mode is not needed.<br> <br> During startup, aggressive acceleration, or when climbing hills - any time high power output is required - the engine operates on all six cylinders. During moderate-speed cruising and at low or moderate engine loads, the system operates just the front bank of three cylinders.<br> <br> The VCM system can tailor the working displacement of the engine to match the driving requirements from moment to moment. Since the system automatically closes both the intake and exhaust valves of the cylinders that are not used, pumping losses associated with intake and exhaust are eliminated and fuel efficiency gets a further boost. The system combines maximum performance and maximum fuel efficiency - two characteristics that don\'t typically coexist in conventional engines.<br> <br> VCM deactivates specific cylinders by using the i-VTEC (intelligent Variable Valve-Timing and Lift Electronic Control) system to close the intake and exhaust valves while the Power Control Module (PCM) simultaneously cuts fuel to those cylinders. The spark plugs continue to fire in inactive cylinders to minimize plug temperature loss and prevent fouling induced from incomplete combustion during cylinder re-activation.<br> <br> The system is electronically controlled, and uses special integrated spool valves in the cylinder heads. Based on commands from the system\'s electronic control unit, the spool valves selectively direct oil pressure to the rocker arms for specific cylinders. This oil pressure in turn drives synchronizing pistons that connect and disconnect the rocker arms.<br> <br> The VCM system monitors throttle position, vehicle speed, engine speed, automatic-transmission gear selection and other factors to determine the correct cylinder activation scheme for the operating conditions. In addition, the system determines whether engine oil pressure is suitable for VCM switching and whether catalytic-converter temperature will remain in the proper range. Importantly, the drive by wire control is able to finely match torques in 6-cylinder and 3-cylinder combustion modes, making the transition between the two virtually unnoticeable.<br> <br> Direct Injection System<br> <br> Conventional engines using multi-port fuel injection mix fuel and air before they enter the combustion chamber. With direct injection, fuel is injected directly into each combustion chamber. This allows for better combustion and overall efficiency.<br> <br> The RLX V-6 engine is the first application of direct injection for an Acura vehicle in the United States. The system features a compact, high-pressure, direct-injection pump that allows both high fuel flow and pulsation suppression, while variable pressure control optimizes injector operation. A multi-hole injector delivers fuel directly into each cylinder (not to the intake port, as in conventional port fuel injection designs).<br> <br> The multi-hole injectors can create the ideal stoichiometric fuel/air mixture in the cylinders for good emissions control. Theoretically, a stoichiometric mixture has just enough air to completely burn the available fuel.<br> <br> Based on the operating conditions, the direct-injection system alters its function for best performance. Upon cold engine startup, fuel is injected into the cylinders on the compression stroke. This creates a weak stratified charge effect that improves engine start-up and reduces exhaust emissions before normal operating temperature is reached.<br> <br> Once the engine is fully warm for maximum power and fuel efficiency, fuel is injected during the intake stroke. This helps create a more homogeneous fuel/air mix in the cylinder that is aided by the high-tumble intake port design. This improves volumetric efficiency, and the cooling effect of the incoming fuel improves anti-knock performance.<br> <br> Active Control Engine Mounts and Active Sound Control<br> <br> A new, more powerful 28-volt Active Control Engine Mount system (ACM) is used to minimize the effects of engine vibration as the VCM system switches cylinders on and off. The 28-volt ACM is a key factor in the VCM\'s broad range of operation in the new RLX. Sensors alert the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to direct ACM actuators positioned at the front and rear of the engine to cancel engine vibration. In the cabin of the RLX, an Active Sound Control system further reduces low frequency sound relating to the function of the VCM system.<br> <br> Vibration Reduction Technology<br> <br> Since the RLX Sport Hybrid\'s gasoline engine can be shut down during certain driving conditions (idle stop), it incorporates measures to mitigate engine vibration during restarts. Compared to the two-wheel-drive RLX, the RLX Sport Hybrid has unique intake cam profiles that close the intake valves later, effectively lowering the compression ratio at startup to reduce vibration. To further reduce vibration, the electrically actuated hydraulic Active Control Mounts are synchronized with engine start-up. A dual-mass flywheel helps further reduce engine vibration when the gasoline engine is in operation.<br> <br> Drive-by-Wire Throttle System<br> <br> The RLX doesn\'t use a conventional throttle cable, but instead has smart electronics that \"connect\" the throttle pedal to a throttle valve inside the throttle-body. The result is less underhood clutter and lower weight, as well as quicker and more accurate throttle actuation. Plus, specially programmed \"gain\" between the throttle pedal and engine offers improved drivability and optimized engine response to suit specific driving conditions.<br> <br> Acura\'s Drive-by-Wire throttle system establishes the current driving conditions by monitoring throttle pedal position, throttle valve position, engine rpm and road speed. This information is used to define the throttle control sensitivity that gives the RLX\'s throttle pedal a predictable and responsive feel that meets driver expectations. There are two different throttle profiles available in the RLX. When the transmission is in \"D\" (Drive) the drive-by-wire system uses the normal profile. When the Sport mode is engaged by pressing the Sport button located near the shift lever, the system changes the throttle map to enhance response feel.<br> <br> Direct Ignition and Detonation/Knock Control<br> <br> The RLX\'s Power Control Module (PCM) monitors engine functions to determine the best ignition spark timing. An engine block-mounted acoustic detonation/knock sensor \"listens\" to the engine, and based on this input, the PCM can retard the ignition timing to prevent potentially damaging detonation. The 3.5L V-6 has an ignition coil unit for each cylinder that is positioned above each spark plug\'s access bore.<br> <br> Close-Coupled Catalysts and Variable Flow Exhaust System<br> <br> The exhaust manifolds of the 3.5L V-6 are cast directly into the aluminum cylinder heads to reduce weight, decrease parts count, and create more underhood space. The result of this casting design is that the two primary catalytic converters are positioned much closer to the combustion chambers. High-efficiency next-generation precious metal catalytic converters are mounted directly to the exhaust port of each cylinder head to enable extremely rapid converter \"light-off\" after the engine starts. A significant weight savings is realized by eliminating traditional exhaust manifolds.<br> <br> Downstream of the close-coupled catalytic converters, a hydroformed 2-into-1 collector pipe carries exhaust gases to a secondary catalytic converter located under the passenger cabin floorboard. This high-flow secondary catalytic converter has a large inlet and outlet to enhance exhaust flow. To balance the engine\'s need for quiet operation at low rpm and higher flow at high rpm, the RLX\'s dual exhaust system incorporates a variable flow rate feature. Pressure-operated exhaust valves in each silencer are closed in normal operation, reducing exhaust noise by as much as 8 dB. When the driver demands more performance from the RLX, rising exhaust gas pressure opens both valves. The additional exhaust flow ads five horsepower to the engine\'s peak output.<br> <br> Emissions Control<br> <br> The 2014 Acura RLX Sport Hybrid utilizes a higher amount of precious metals in its under-floor catalyst to meet CARB LEV III SULEV 30 emissions standards.<br> <br> A number of advanced technologies are factors in the emissions performance. The unique cylinder head-mounted close-coupled catalytic converters light off more quickly after engine start up, and a 32-bit RISC microprocessor within the powertrain control module (PCM) boosts computing power to improve the precision of spark and fuel delivery.<br> <br> The RLX\'s V-6 engine features Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) that continually adjusts the fuel delivery to yield the best combination of power, low fuel consumption and low emissions. Multiple sensors constantly monitor critical engine operating parameters such as intake air temperature, ambient air pressure, throttle position, intake airflow volume, intake manifold pressure, coolant temperature, exhaust-to-air ratios, as well as the position of the crankshaft and the camshafts.<br> <br> To further improve emissions compliance, the 3.5L V-6 makes use of an after-cat design exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system that allows cleaner, cooler EGR gas to be fed back into the intake system. An EGR system, especially one that delivers a cleaner/cooler charge, reduces pumping loss for better fuel efficiency.<br> <br> One-Touch Start System<br> <br> To ensure consistent starting, the RLX has a one-touch start system that maintains starter engagement until the engine starts. Should the driver release the Start button before the engine starts, the system will start the vehicle. Simply push the Start button (with the fob in the vehicle) and the engine will automatically start up.<br> <br> Noise &amp; Vibration Control<br> <br> With its 60-degree V-angle and compact, rigid and lightweight die-cast aluminum cylinder block assembly, the 3.5L V-6 powerplant is exceptionally smooth during operation. Other factors that help reduce engine noise and vibration are a rigid forged-steel crankshaft, die-cast accessory mounts, and a stiff cast-aluminum oil pan that reduces cylinder block flex.<br> <br> Idle Stop Feature<br> <br> Idle stop stops cylinder combustion and cylinder activation, eliminating fuel use when the vehicle is stopped, such as at traffic light or in heavy traffic conditions. The engine is restarted by the 35-kilowatt front motor-generator using energy from the lithium ion hybrid battery pack. Unlike some competing systems, the engine restart is extremely smooth and refined, practically undetectable to the vehicle\'s occupants.<br> <br> 7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT)<br> <br> To maximize performance and fuel efficiency, the RLX Sport Hybrid has a standard 7-Speed Dual-Clutch Transmission (DCT). In the 7-speed DCT, one clutch controls the odd gears while the other clutch controls the even gears. This arrangement allows gear changes with a much smaller interruption in power to the wheels, resulting in millisecond-quick shifts. Compared to a conventional manual transmission, the operation of the clutches and shifting mechanisms are electronically controlled, eliminating the need for a clutch pedal or shift lever. Compared to a conventional automatic, the torque converter and its mechanical inefficiencies are also eliminated. The DCT transmission in the RLX Sport Hybrid also features a 17-percent wider ratio range than the 6-speed automatic transmission in the RLX with P-AWS.<br> <br> Electronic Gear Selector<br> <br> In the RLX Sport Hybrid, a conventional console-mounted shift lever is replaced with an all-new Electronic Gear Selector fully electronic, shift-by-wire gear selector. Park, Neutral and Drive are selected with the push of a button. Reverse is selected by pulling back a dedicated switch. Indicator lights near the buttons indicate the mode selected. As an added safety feature, if the vehicle is brought to a stop in Drive, the system will automatically select Park if the driver\'s seatbelt is unbuckled and the driver\'s door is opened.<br> <br> Transmission Modes<br> <br> When in Drive mode, the 7-speed dual-clutch transmission can be controlled steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters. While traveling up or down hills, Grade Logic Control alters the transmission\'s shift schedule to reduce shift frequency and improve speed control. A shift map in the transmission computer continually measures throttle position, vehicle speed and acceleration/deceleration, and then determines when the vehicle is on a hill. The shift schedule is then adjusted to hold the transmission in lower gears to boost climbing power or to provide engine braking when traveling downhill.<br> <br> Shift Hold Control keeps the transmission in its current (lower) gear ratio when aggressive driving is detected, as in the case of decelerating at a corner entry. Shift Hold Control leaves the chassis undisturbed by excess shifting and ensures that power will be immediately available (without a downshift) at the corner exit.<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid features Sport and Normal modes. A selector button located on the center console allows the driver to toggle between the two operating modes. Normal mode is aimed at overall energy efficiency. Sport mode, by contrast, puts greater emphasis on the driving experience, delivering a more responsive and direct feel. Sport mode offers more aggressive and sporty shift mapping, engine rpm \"blips\" on downshifts, while VCM and idle stop functions are cancelled. All of the transmission logic systems work together to automatically alter shift timing based on driving conditions.<br> <br> Temporary Manual Operation in \"Drive\"<br> <br> Whether in Drive or Sport mode, special transmission logic programming allows the use of the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. When the driver operates the steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters while in Drive, the transmission responds to the driver\'s shift command and then returns to its normal fully automatic mode if further paddle shift inputs are not made within a given time. This special logic makes it easy for the driver to command a quick downshift without leaving the comfort of Drive mode. When in Sport mode, use of the paddle shifters puts the transmission into full manual mode that remains until another mode of operation is selected.<br> <br> Manual Mode<br> <br> By pressing the \"Sport\" button located near the gear selector button, Sport mode is engaged. This mode offers automatic operation with more aggressive shift mapping. A pull on the racing-inspired paddle shifters (mounted on the steering wheel) places the transmission in fully manual mode. A digital display in the instrument cluster indicates which gear the transmission is in. The system reverts to normal fully automatic mode if further paddle shift inputs are not made within a given time.<br> <br> Sport Hybrid Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD)<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid is the first production vehicle to employ an electric version of Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD). Previous mechanical versions of SH-AWD had the ability to vary the amount of power sent to the rear axle, and to also vary rear power distribution between the left and right rear wheels via a longitudinally mounted drive shaft and rear differential with twin electronically controlled clutch packs.<br> <br> In the RLX Sport Hybrid, the driveshaft and rear differential of a conventional all-wheel drive system is eliminated, replaced by twin 27-kilowatt (36 hp) electric motors that independently drive the left and right rear wheels. Each motor can also capture regenerative braking energy and apply negative (regenerative braking) torque to further enhance cornering capability.<br> <br> Independent distribution of torque to all four wheels is a key feature of SH-AWD and its ability to enhance both dynamic handling and all-weather traction. When cornering, more positive (drive) torque is applied to the outside rear wheel, while negative (regenerative braking) torque can be applied to the inside rear wheel. This torque differential creates a yaw moment, producing sharper turn-in, more linear cornering, enhanced traceability and improved steering response with reduced understeer tendencies. In addition, since the system doesn\'t rely on the gasoline engine for torque, electric SH-AWD can create a larger torque difference between the left and right rear wheels, even during small throttle applications, at low engine speeds, or even during deceleration (such as lifting throttle mid-corner). This substantially magnifies the positive handling benefits of SH-AWD across a much wider range of driving conditions.<br> <br> Power Drive Unit (PDU)<br> <br> The Power Drive Unit, packaged in the center of the vehicle beneath the center console, dictates the power management strategy of the Sport Hybrid SH-AWD system, including motor power and battery recharge.<br> <br> Intelligent Power Unit (IPU)<br> <br> The Intelligent Power Unit is positioned above the Twin Motor Unit, behind the rear seatback. The IPU contains the hybrid system\'s lithium-ion battery, 12-volt DC/DC converter, junction board, and Electronic Control Units (ECU) for the motors and the battery. The IPU is air-cooled via an integrated fan unit that draws air from inside the vehicle cabin via an intake duct located beneath the rear seats.<br> <br> 1.3-kWh Lithium-Ion Battery<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid\'s advanced 72-cell lithium-ion battery has 29 percent greater power density and 5 percent greater energy density compared to the lithium-ion battery in the ILX hybrid.<br> <br> Front Electric Motor<br> <br> A single 35-kilowatt (47 hp) electric motor is integrated with the 7-speed DCT. The motor\'s operating temperature is optimized by a temperature-controlled flow of Automatic Transmission Fluid (ATF) through the motor housing. By tightly controlling the motor temperature, the motor\'s torque output (both drive and regeneration) can be improved up to 100 percent.<br> <br> Twin Motor Unit (TMU)<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid\'s Twin Motor Unit (TMU) is located in between the rear wheels, where a differential on an all-wheel-drive vehicle is typically mounted. Inside its die-cast aluminum housing are two electric motors positioned back-to-back. Each 27-kilowatt (36-horsepower) motor powers a single rear wheel and can also apply negative torque to the same wheel. A clutch allows each motor to be decoupled from its wheel in certain operating situations to improve efficiency.<br> <br> Electrically Powered Air Conditioning Compressor<br> <br> Since the RLX Sport Hybrid engine has an idle-stop feature, it is equipped with an electrically powered air conditioning compressor. This allows continuous air conditioning operation even when the gasoline engine is shut off.<br> <br> Hybrid System Safety<br> <br> To maximize passenger safety, the hybrid system components are positioned in well-protected areas of the vehicle. In the event of a collision that triggers the airbags, an automatic high-voltage circuit interrupt in the Intelligent Power Unit cuts power to the hybrid system.<br> <br> 100,000 Mile Tune-up Intervals<br> <br> The RLX\'s 3.5L V-6 requires no scheduled maintenance for 100,000+/- miles or more, other than periodic inspections and normal fluid and filter replacements. The first tune-up includes water pump inspection, valve adjustment, replacement of the camshaft timing belt, and the installation of new spark plugs.<br> <br> Maintenance Minder™ System<br> <br> To eliminate unnecessary service stops while ensuring that the vehicle is properly maintained, the RLX Sport Hybrid has a Maintenance Minder™ system that continually monitors the vehicle\'s operating condition. When maintenance is required, the driver is alerted via a message on the Multi-Information Display (MID).<br> <br> The Maintenance Minder™ system monitors operating conditions such as oil and coolant temperature along with engine speed to determine the proper service intervals. Depending on operating conditions, oil change intervals can be extended to a maximum of 10,000 miles, potentially sparing the owner considerable expenditures and inconvenience over the life of the vehicle. The owner-resettable system monitors all normal service parts and systems, including oil and filter, tire rotation, air-cleaner, automatic transmission fluid, spark plugs, timing belt, coolant and more. To avoid driver distraction while the vehicle is being operated, maintenance alerts are presented on the MID when the ignition is first turned on.<br> <br> Design Concept<br> <br> Bristling with technological advances in lighting, aerodynamics and construction, the 2014 RLX Sport Hybrid SH-AWD body has the technology to match its athletic and sophisticated design. Lightweight and aerodynamic, the body provides outstanding collision protection, confidence-inspiring high-speed stability, and exceptional fuel efficiency.<br> <br> The RLX\'s dynamic body design combines a sleek overall shape, \"aero-fused\" cabin silhouette, and close tolerances for the wheel wells and body-panel gaps for a high degree of elegance and aerodynamics. The styling begins with a dynamic front-end featuring the RLX\'s signature Jewel Eye™ LED headlights, a substantial presence that imparts a look of power and confidence, while also proving highly aerodynamically efficient, providing powerful down the road illumination and even encompassing advanced pedestrian safety features.<br> <br> Decisive character lines start alongside the hood, sweep over the front wheel arches, and then along the body sides. The body sides feature decisive character lines that subtly rise along the lower body sides, dramatically changing the light reflections and creating an especially dynamic visual signature for the RLX.<br> <br> This athletic and sophisticated look is complemented by a flowing, aerodynamically sleek cabin design. Referred to by Acura designers as an \"aero fused shape,\" the cabin is wide but also extremely aerodynamic, allowing both a roomy interior and a quiet ride quality as air slips smoothly over the cabin\'s flush-mounted available acoustic glass and other drag- and turbulence-reducing design details.<br> <br> The wheel-arch hems use a much smaller gap to the tire than on the RL - and also a much smaller gap than is typical for the segment. This results in a more poised, integrated and finished look for the RLX side profile. The wheel-arch hems are also beautifully finished, adding to the sense of quality. Likewise, the hood, door and trunk-panel gaps are carefully controlled, with the aggregate effect that the RLX is immensely well crafted.<br> <br> Beneath the vehicle is a sophisticated series of aerodynamic aids that further smooth airflow. These include an engine undercover, left and right floor covers, left and right mid under covers, and a rear under cover.<br> <br> The rear of the RLX body is also dynamic, and here the cabin is noticeably wider than either of the outgoing RL or the RLX\'s primary competitors, lending a look of soliditydue to the wider overall body and track widths.<br> <br> Additional model-exclusive design cues for the RLX Sport Hybrid include a dark chrome-plated grill insert and redesigned lower front bumper fascia with integrated LED fog lights and turn signal indicators. The RLX Sport Hybrid has exclusive 19-inch, 10-spoke alloy wheels and \"Hybrid\" badging on the front fender. Also, SH-AWD badging replaces the P-AWS badge on the right rear portion of the trunk lid.<br> <br> Seven different exterior colors, including four metallic and three pearl, are designed to complement the exterior shape and the way light defines it.<br> <br> The Acura RLX Sport Hybrid utilizes numerous aluminum components to lower the overall vehicle mass by 76 pounds, which helps to improve acceleration, steering and handling response, road-holding, braking performance, fuel efficiency, emissions, and crash safety. Aluminum components include the front and rear bumper beams, front fenders, hood, steering column mounting beam, floor pan, and door skins.<br> <br> Exterior Dimensions<br> <br> The 2014 RLX Sport Hybrid is larger than the previous RL model in several key exterior dimensions, including width, wheelbase, and front and rear track. In overall length, the RLX measures 196.1 inches - just 0.2 inches longer than the previous model; however its wheelbase, at 112.2 inches, is a full two inches longer, providing more rear passenger room and improved the ride quality.<br> <br> At 74.4 inches wide, the RLX is a substantial 1.8 inches wider than the previous model, contributing to the RLX\'s more spacious interior - now with an impressive 36.4 inches between seating rows - its more confident visual presence, and improved handling stability.<br> <br> At 57.7 inches high, the RLX is just 0.4 inches taller than the model it replaces.<br> <br> Among its competitive set, the new RLX is longer and wider than the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Lexus GS series, and Mercedes-Benz E-Class.<br> <br> Waiting Status<br> <br> When parked and locked, the folding exterior mirrors retract, the security alarm system is armed, and the RLX goes into standby mode, waiting for its owner to return. Then when the driver (in possession of the key fob) approaches the vehicle, it unlocks the driver\'s door (or all doors if so programmed). When the driver opens the door to be seated, the RLX adjusts the seat and steering column to the preset positions, actives the instrumentation and sets the other features such as climate-control and audio-system presents to match the driver.<br> <br> Body Rigidity<br> <br> Static and dynamic rigidity and rear lateral stiffness are all improved versus the RL and even compared to the RL-X with P-AWS. Static bending rigidity is up 53 percent and torsional rigidity is up 47 percent compared to the previous RL model (1 percent up from the RLX with P-AWS). In addition, rear lateral stiffness and the torsional rigidity of the rear upper damper mounting points are up 107 percent and 63 percent, respectively, compared to the previous RL (and up 25 percent and 12 percent when compared to the RLX with P-AWS).<br> <br> High-Strength Steel<br> <br> To increase stiffness and rigidity in key areas without increasing weight, 55 percent of the RLX body is made from high-strength steel, including the strategic use of ultra-high strength \"hot stamped\" 1500Mpa steel.<br> <br> Aluminum Body Components<br> <br> Extensive use of aluminum in key areas saves 76.1 pounds compared to traditional all-steel construction, providing high strength with light weight that directly benefits ride, handling, fuel efficiency, emissions reductions and safety. The biggest weight savings from a single component comes from the use of an aluminum hood, which saves 19.6 pounds compared to a steel hood. Aluminum body components include:<br> <br> Hood<br> Front bumper beam<br> Front fenders<br> Floor tunnel bar<br> Rear bumper beam<br> Steering-column hangar beam<br> Front door skin<br> Rear door skin<br> <br> Aluminum Hybrid Construction Door<br> <br> The RLX doors are a hybrid construction utilizing aluminum outer panels for lighter weight and steel inner panels for stiffness and crash safety performance. Together, they provide for increased stiffness with a weight reduction of 24.3 pounds compared to all-steel doors.<br> <br> The front doors are constructed of four parts, while the rear doors are constructed of five parts. The steel inner panel uses a special high-corrosion-protection zinc, aluminum and magnesium plating - 11 percent aluminum, 3 percent magnesium and 86 percent zinc - to assure that electrolytic corrosion does not occur between the two metals. This plating gives the steel inner panel 10 times the resistance of traditional zinc galvanized plating.<br> <br> The outer aluminum skin and steel inside panels are joined with an Acura-first \"curl forming\" process for high-strength and durability.<br> <br> Class-Leading Aerodynamics<br> <br> More than 800 wind-tunnel tests were conducted to improve vehicle aerodynamics values. As a result, the new RLX will have class-leading lower coefficient of lift (CL) and lower coefficient of drag (Cd).<br> <br> Sound Insulation<br> <br> Engineers paid particular attention to reducing interior noise, an effort that extends to literally every aspect of the vehicle\'s design and engineering - from aerodynamics and powertrain engineering to insulators and the selection of finishing materials - all play a part in the RLX\'s improved interior quietness.<br> <br> To achieve a premium level of interior quietness, the RLX receives an unprecedented amount of acoustic material in key areas. The list includes:<br> <br> Carpet back surface<br> Inside front/rear door lining<br> Inside A-pillars<br> Inside C-pillars<br> Roof area behind moonroof opening<br> Floor sills<br> Inside trunk lid<br> Rear deck<br> Rear bulkhead<br> Rear wheel wells<br> <br> To mitigate additional sound from the hybrid drive motors, the RLX Sport Hybrid features additional application of sound deadening materials in rear passenger floor and trunk floor insulators.<br> <br> Acoustic Door Glass<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid uses laminated, sound-insulating acoustic glass for all door glass, providing an extra measure of wind and road noise attenuation (same as RLX with P-AWS Technology and higher grades). The glass is 4.7mm thick and includes an acoustic membrane that helps attenuate frequencies above 1,600 Hz, resulting in an improvement of up to 14.7 dB over the previous model\'s 5mm thick tempered door glass.<br> <br> Jewel Eye™ Headlights<br> <br> The 2014 RLX Sport Hybrid features Acura Jewel Eye™ LED headlights, which utilize a dual-stacked array of high-intensity LED lamps to deliver outstanding light distribution, and class-leading distant irradiation performance and light characteristics with a wavelength close to the human eye\'s luminosity curve. With two rows of five \"Jewel Eye\" lights per headlight, the LED lights provide improved down the road visibility compared to HID and halogen headlights.<br> <br> On each side of the RLX, the low beams consist of four LED lights, while the innermost high beams utilize a pair of larger LED lights. The daytime running light (DRL) function is shared by the low-beam lenses, with the eight individual lenses clearly and dramatically visible even in bright sunlight. Altogether, they create a dramatic and distinctive appearance with superior lighting capability.<br> <br> Light distribution<br> <br> Both the low and separate high beam LED headlights offer outstanding performance in all nighttime driving conditions, including highway, winding roads, intersections, and in inclement weather conditions. The result is that the driver can see further with uniformity, making high-speed nighttime driving easier and less fatiguing.<br> <br> A summary of LED benefits include:<br> <br> Outstanding light distribution that surpasses competitors<br> Excellent distant illumination performance<br> Clear illumination of the road surface and white lines<br> High visibility of the entire visible color spectrum (white, red, green, blue and yellow) compared to HID and halogen headlights<br> Response time when switching between low and high beam is shortened<br> Light congruity is improved between low and high beams<br> <br> When the lights are off, sunlight enters the display through the top of the lens, reflects off the rear reflector and then forward and through the lens again. As a result when lighting is off, the array still appears to be shining.<br> <br> LED Taillights<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid taillights utilize periphery LED illumination that is both effective and highly distinctive. The taillight array consists of two semi-circular LED rings sweeping across the rear fender edges and the sides of the trunk lid. The light path combines functions of both the taillights and the side marker lights in one array. This LED array matches the \"Jewel Eye\" headlights for elegance and clearly distinguishes the RLX from every other vehicle on the road - even at a distance and especially at night. It also compliments the RLX body design.<br> <br> LED taillight components include the LED assembly, a housing/reflector and inner and outer lenses. Uniform illumination is provided by a combination of light diffusion and the specially grained finish of both an inner lens and a reflecting surface. Inside the periphery LED taillight array is a separate lighting array consisting of the stoplights and turn signals. Backup lights are located on the trunk lid, inside the perimeter taillight array.<br> <br> LED Fog Lights<br> <br> LED fog lights present a smaller face than traditional fog lights, making them less susceptible to damage, while offering longer life, lower energy draw and more desirable color.<br> <br> One-Touch Turn Signals<br> <br> The RLX\'s one-touch turn signals provide increased convenience for the driver when making routine lane changes. With the one-touch turn signal system, a quick movement of the turn-signal lever (between 0.4 sec. and 1 sec.) provides three blinks of the turn signals - an ideal scenario for changing lanes. Holding the lever for 1 sec. or longer (past the \"click point\") provides continuous blinking, such as for signaling a turn or exiting a thoroughfare.<br> <br> Retracting Mirrors<br> <br> At the driver\'s preference, the RLX\'s door mirrors on some grades can be configured to automatically retract when the doors are locked, and then automatically extend when the doors are unlocked. This automatic mirror retract/extend function helps safeguard the mirrors when the RLX is parked, while also creating a higher-quality experience for the driver by eliminating the need to remember to manually retract or extend the mirrors.<br> <br> The mirrors automatically retract or extend in two ways: 1) simply press the lock/unlock button on the remote key fob; or 2) press the lock button on the door handle.<br> <br> The mirrors can also be retracted and extended by using the mirror switch on the driver\'s door panel. These functions can be customized through the MID on the instrument panel.<br> <br> Expanded View Driver\'s Mirror<br> <br> The 2014 RLX\'s Expanded View Driver\'s Mirror is integrated into the driver\'s side mirror. Standard equipment on all trim levels, the mirror increases the driver\'s field of vision by 6.5-degrees to provide a better view of objects that would otherwise be hidden in the vehicle\'s blind spot. This allows the driver to better recognize vehicles that are in their blind zone.<br> <br> The major part of the mirror is flat and provides 15.1-degrees of visibility. Adding the 6.5-degrees of the Expanded View Driver\'s Mirror yields 21.6-degrees of visibility. In addition, the expansion of the view area gradually changes between flat and convex for a more natural user experience.<br> <br> Intelligent Wipers<br> <br> Laws in some states require drivers to turn on the headlights when the wipers are operating in the rain. The new RLX helps its driver comply with these laws by automatically illuminating the headlights when the wipers are activated in rainy conditions (with headlight switch in Auto). Operation is shown via an indicator on the instrument panel. If rain is intermittent, the lights stay on for a predetermined interval before automatically turning off again.<br> <br> Wiper operation is equally advanced for maximum wiping area, better wiping quality, reduced weight, improved appearance and longer blade life. Details include:<br> <br> Wiper coverage is maximized by controlling the wiper position, including to the outer corners of the windshield.<br> Wiper performance is maximized by adjusting the wiper speed according to road speed and wind pressure.<br> The wiper motor uses a built-in ECU, reducing complexity compared to the RL wiper mechanism. The new RLX wiper motor assembly saves 4.6 pounds in comparison.<br> For better appearance, the wipers are hidden under the hood when not in operation.<br> For extended life of the wiper blades\' rubber, the operating system periodically raises the wiper blades from underneath the hood (when not in use) to prevent blade deformation.<br> <br> Self-Opening Trunk<br> <br> The RLX trunk has a self-opening feature that fully opens the trunk lid. There are three ways to open the trunk: 1) by pressing the trunk opener switch located on the driver side door panel, 2) with the key fob and 3) with the trunk opener switch located in the middle of the trunk, underneath the trunk lid garnish. This makes it easier for the RLX driver to carry items and open the trunk lid at the same time. In contrast, the previous RL model, the trunk lid would open halfway compared to the RLX\'s fully open function. The trunk lid closes manually.<br> <br> Trunk Storage<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid offers 12.0 cu.-ft. of trunk storage capacity (down from 15.3 cu. ft. in the RLX with P-AWS and 15.1 cu.-ft. in RLX models with Krell Audio and Advance grades). All measurements include the tool kit and the puncture repair kit. A cargo net allows for storage of smaller items in an areas suspended above the cargo floor. Also, beneath the floor panel is a 0.4 cu.-ft. covered storage well.<br> <br> Multi-Angle Rearview Camera<br> <br> The RLX\'s standard multi-angle rearview camera features three viewing angles - Wide view, Normal view and Top Down view. Drivers may select the preferred view according to driving conditions. The rearview camera system also features dynamic guidelines that display the vehicle\'s backward trajectory according to steering-wheel position. When the steering wheel is straight, a broad 180-degree rearward view can be seen in Wide View, and Normal and Top Down views are also available. However when the steering wheel is turned 90 degrees, only Wide and Normal views are available, and dynamic guidelines curve onscreen to show the path of the vehicle. The result is improved convenience for the driver as the rearward trajectory of the RLX is indicated by the dynamic guidelines.<br> <br> Rear Wheel Arch Hem<br> <br> The RLX\'s sleek exterior design is enhanced by close tolerances between the tires and the wheel arches. Specially designed wheel-arch hems reduce the gap to just 46 mm between the top of the tire and the lower part of the wheel arch, 10.5-mm narrower than that of the previous RL model. As a result, the tires better fill the wheel wells for a greater sense of unity and substance.<br> <br> Exterior Colors<br> <br> The 2014 RLX Sport Hybrid is available in seven exterior colors, including four metallic and three pearl colors. All colors have a strong character, offering expressive contrasts that compliment the RLX\'s body-panel curves and angles, while also exhibiting a smart luxury appearance. The acid-resistant epoxy clear-coat paint is superior to typical clear-coat paints for increased resistance to urban pollutants.<br> <br> Chassis Concept<br> <br> The goal behind the RLX Sport Hybrid chassis was to deliver \"the synergy between man and machine\" or dynamic handling that truly responds to \"the will of the driver.\" This refers to the way in which Acura engineers envisioned the entire package of the RLX responding instantaneously and precisely, with technology used to improve the driver\'s capability and confidence. The result is a vehicle that, more than any Acura before it, creates a driving experience that performs at the will of the driver.<br> <br> Sport Mode<br> <br> A driver-selectable Sport mode further enhances driving dynamics across a wide range of driving situations. When the driver engages the Sport button on the center console, the system adopts more aggressive shift mapping and rear wheel torque-vectoring control. The system also deactivates Idle Stop, Variable Cylinder Management (no 3-cylinder mode) and the Reactive Force Pedal, plus the Active Sound Control system is modified to provide an even sportier driving experience.<br> <br> Front Aluminum Subframe<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid has a lightweight and rigid front aluminum front subframe that is specifically designed to support the high performance of the double wishbone, lower double-joint front suspension with Amplitude Reactive Dampers and belt-type Electric Power Steering (EPS) system. Using die cast front corners, the Acura RLX Sport Hybrid\'s front subframe is also wider across the middle, features wider middle and rear rails, and a wider rear section vs. RL to accommodate the new EPS system. Rigidity is up 82 percent compared to RL.<br> <br> With its lightweight and rigidity, the new aluminum front subframe contributes to agile and light handling, straight-line stability, higher fuel efficiency, flat cornering and pleasing ride comfort, and smooth and precise steering feel (with reduced torque steer tendencies).<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid subframe is matched to the Active Control Engine Mount (ACM) system that is engineered specifically for the RLX\'s higher-output engine and Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system.<br> <br> Lower Double-Joint Front Suspension<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid utilizes the same double-wishbone, lower double-joint front suspension as the RLX with P-AWS, which significantly improves intuitive handling agility, driver confidence and security, and ride sophistication. The system includes a lower double joint with a split lower control arm, optimized kingpin geometry, upper control arm, hydraulic compliance bushing, special dual-stage Amplitude Reactive Dampers made for Acura by ZF-Sachs, and a stabilizer bar that is heat treated for high strength.<br> <br> Benefits include:<br> <br> Agility - Improved steering feel characteristics including stability, linearity, response and tracing performance<br> Driver Confidence - Increased high speed linearity with reduced torque steer/pulling, shimmy and judder<br> Ride Sophistication - Flat ride with reduced harshness and steering vibration<br> <br> Multi-Link Rear Suspension<br> <br> Like the lower double-joint front suspension, the RLX Sport Hybrid\'s multi-link rear suspension with Amplitude Reactive Dampers provides optimal handling agility, driver confidence and ride sophistication. The multi-link system geometry is optimized for a flat ride during cornering, confident turning capability, and a sophisticated ride in a variety of urban, highway and open road scenarios. The system includes multi-link control arms, control-arm bushings that are optimized for the best blend of NVH isolation and handling precision, Amplitude Reactive Dampers, and a rear stabilizer bar that is hardened with a special shot-peening process.<br> <br> Amplitude Reactive Dampers<br> <br> Amplitude Reactive Dampers provide superior ride comfort and handling in all driving conditions. The dampers have two separate damping mechanisms: one that is tuned for maximum efficiency on smoother roads with small inputs; and the other that is tuned to handle large inputs such as rough roads, potholes, and sudden steering and braking action. The result is a vehicle that remains composed and comfortable in a wide range of driving conditions.<br> <br> The core technology contained within the Amplitude Reactive Dampers is their two separate damping pistons, including a main piston and a second piston. To improve overall ride comfort, when smaller inputs occur during normal driving conditions, only the main piston works to provide the ideal damping characteristics. To improve the RLX\'s ride and handling during more severe conditions, the second piston operates to provide additional damping force.<br> <br> The Amplitude Reactive Dampers are a purely mechanical system that does not require electronic controls. Altogether, they provide a much wider range of damping performance than the previous RL.<br> <br> High-Output Electric Power Steering (EPS)<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid Electric Power Steering (EPS) system uses a high-power, belt-type electric steering assist. The system increases the torque available to assist the driver in steering the vehicle smoothly, with instantaneous response, direct feel, and improved low-speed agility and high-speed stability.<br> <br> The variable gear ratio EPS uses a high-output electric assist motor with a belt-drive system. The system is designed and tuned to provide the two most essential characteristics in a high-performance luxury vehicle\'s steering. These include a smooth initial response (shorter delay) at the start of steering input, and greater linearity response (steering force camber increase) as input is increased. As a result, the RLX\'s high-output EPS provides agile performance in low-speed driving maneuvers such as at intersections, improved overall accuracy and road feel, and superb high-speed stability.<br> <br> Rigid Steering Column<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid steering column is a highly rigid design with an aluminum bracket and resin angular bearing. The resulting stiffness gives maximum driver steering feedback along with minimizing vibration felt in the wheel.<br> <br> The steering shaft is significantly larger in diameter than the shaft found in the previous RL, and together with the stiff but lightweight aluminum support bracket and angular bearing, yields maximum vibration-damping characteristics for a more luxurious driving experience.<br> <br> Electrically actuated tilt and telescoping adjustment makes it easy to set the steering wheel to the ideal position for drivers of different sizes.<br> <br> 4-Wheel Disc Brakes with ABS and Brake Assist<br> <br> RLX Sport Hybrid is equipped with 4-wheel disc brakes with a 4-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) for confident stops. The front discs measure 12.99 inches in diameter, while the rear discs measure 12.2 inches in diameter.<br> <br> ABS independently modulates braking power at each wheel to help the driver retain steering control during heavy braking, while Brake Assist recognizes emergency braking situations and almost instantly applies full braking force when appropriate.<br> <br> The brake pads are a high-friction type for peak stopping performance even under strenuous conditions. The brake calipers are designed to reduce brake drag when not in use, reducing rolling resistance and improving fuel efficiency in the process.<br> <br> Electric Servo Brakes<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid\'s electric servo brake system maximizes regenerative braking capability for improved fuel efficiency. The braking system is fully hydraulic from the master cylinder all the way to the 4-wheel disc brakes, just like a traditional braking system. The key difference is that the braking function is electronically controlled rather than a purely mechanical activation, allowing regenerative braking from the front and rear electric motors to slow the vehicle, rather than the hydraulic friction brakes, under most circumstances. Besides its payoff in efficiency, the system offers excellent feel and feedback for the driver through the brake pedal.<br> <br> When the driver applies the brake pedal, a signal is sent to the vehicle\'s Electronic Control Unit (ECU), which determines the appropriate amount of braking force to assign to regenerative braking through the electric drive motor and to the hydraulic friction braking system. In many cases, friction braking is not needed until the vehicle speed drops below 9 mph, as the vehicle slows to a final stop. When the ECU determines that friction braking is needed, the dual hydraulic master cylinder pumps brake fluid through the system. Midway between the master cylinder and the calipers is a separate motorized electronic actuator. This actuator receives an electronic signal, generated in the master cylinder module that precisely defines how the driver has applied the brakes - soft or hard, slow or fast. The actuator then directly apportions hydraulic pressure to the brake calipers at each wheel.<br> <br> While the RLX with P-AWS uses a 10-inch vacuum booster to assist the driver in applying needed brake pressure, the RLX Sport Hybrid uses an electric servo brake actuator.<br> <br> Reactive Force Pedal<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid is the first model to apply the Acura-developed Reactive Force Pedal technology. In Normal mode, the system measures vehicle speed and dynamically varies pedal force to help the driver in applying the optimal amount of throttle for both spirited performance and good fuel economy. In slippery conditions, the system can also help the driver apply the optimal amount of driving force while minimizing wheel slip, utilizing input from the Vehicle Stability Assist system. Further, in the event that the Collision Mitigation Brake System (CMBS) detects that a frontal collision is imminent, the Reactive Force Pedal will push back on the driver\'s foot even before the CMBS system activates its visual and auditory alerts.<br> <br> Electric Parking Brake + Automatic Brake Hold<br> <br> The combination of Electric Parking Brake (EPB) and Automatic Brake Hold are a first for the Acura division. Together, they meaningfully reduce the effort of driving the vehicle, thereby raising overall comfort to a true flagship level.<br> <br> Electric Parking Brake<br> <br> The Electric Parking Brake (EPB) on the RLX Sport Hybrid makes using the parking brake easier and more comfortable. Actuating the parking brake is now as simple as pulling a button on the center console. To release the parking brake, the driver simply presses on the accelerator pedal. In addition to being simpler, more convenient and more comfortable to use than a traditional parking brake, the new Electric Parking Brake makes hill starts easier when the RLX is parked on a grade.<br> <br> The ease of use also promotes the use of the parking brake. Further, since only a few competitive vehicles have an Electric Parking Brake (EPB) system, its inclusion in the RLX further defines the new Acura as a true flagship. As with a traditional manually activated parking brake, EPB functions on the rear wheels only.<br> <br> Automatic Brake Hold<br> <br> The Acura RLX Sport Hybrid also features Automatic Brake Hold, which retains brake pressure when the vehicle is stopped, simplifying driving in heavy traffic or hills. This frees the driver from continually pressing the brake pedal to maintain the vehicle in a stopped position, a significant improvement in driving enjoyment in difficult conditions.<br> <br> Operating the system requires two simple actions from the driver:<br> <br> Activating/deactivating the system via a switch on the center console.<br> Pressing on the brake pedal when the vehicle comes to a stop.<br> <br> Once these steps are taken, Automatic Brake Hold will indicate engagement and then maintain brake pressure when the vehicle has come to a stop, even if the driver releases the brake pedal. The RLX then remains stopped - even on a hill - until the driver presses the accelerator pedal. At this point Automatic Brake Hold releases the brakes and the vehicle resumes normal braking function.<br> <br> Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®)<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid\'s high-efficiency Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA) works in conjunction with the ABS and the Drive-by-Wire throttle systems. This premium VSA system enhances vehicle stability when cornering. If vehicle understeer or oversteer is detected, the system selectively reduces power and/or applies braking force to individual wheels to help correct the condition and stabilize the vehicle.<br> <br> Traction control monitors front-wheel slippage, such as when starting on slick surfaces or patches of ice. If it is detected, traction control activates one or more brake calipers and reduces engine torque to slow the spinning wheel so it can regain traction.<br> <br> Agile Handling Assist<br> <br> Agile Handling Assist works in near limit cornering by using the brakes to create a yaw moment, helping the driver smoothly and easily trace the desired line with smaller steering-wheel inputs. The result is improved dynamic performance in all driving conditions, helping the RLX Sport Hybrid perform at the will of the driver.<br> <br> Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)<br> <br> A standard Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) helps the driver maintain proper air pressure to improve driving safety and fuel efficiency, as well as reduce wear and tear on the vehicle\'s tires. Located in the instrument panel, a TPMS icon illuminates to alert the driver whenever any of the tires has a significantly low-pressure reading that requires the driver\'s attention.<br> <br> Noise-Reducing Wheels<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid features model-exclusive10-spoke, 19x8J alloy wheels with a painted Glitter Silver Metallic finish. The RLX Sport Hybrid\'s wheels have a special noise-reducing design that lowers noise by as much as 7 dB in the mid-frequency range. The key elements of the noise-reducing four resin moldings fitted on the inside of the wheel rim. The result is reduced noise resonance in the air column inside the wheel.<br> <br> All-Season Tires<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid is shod with 245/40R19 M+S tires. The RLX features an easy-to-use tire repair kit in lieu of a spare tire. This reduces weight and increases trunk volume, and simplifies temporary repairs in the event of a flat tire.<br> <br> Capless Fueling System<br> <br> The RLX\'s capless fueling eliminates the fuel cap, meaning that fueling the vehicle now simply requires opening the fuel-tank lid, refueling, and then closing the lid. This reduces the possibility of damaging the vehicle\'s paint with the fuel cap or tether, or forgetting the fuel cap at the gas station. The system also allows the use of a smaller fuel-cap door, which cleans up the lines of the vehicle.<br> <br> The system consists of two integrated components, including an outer shutter mechanism that prevents the intrusion of dirt and dust, and a self-sealing fueling flap that is closed by a torsion spring. Both operate automatically.<br> <br> At a gas station, the driver simply opens the fuel lid (which automatically locks with the doors) and then inserts the fuel nozzle. Inserting the nozzle automatically opens the outer shutter and fueling flap. When fueling is complete, removing the fuel nozzle automatically closes both the fueling flap and outer shutter.<br> <br> 15.1-Gallon Fuel Capacity<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid\'s resin fuel tank capacity of 15.1 gallons gives the RLX an ample cruising range. Both the fuel tank and fuel pipe are made of high-impact resin for lightweight and durability. The fuel tank is located in a protected area in front of the rear suspension.<br> <br> INTERIOR<br> <br> The 2014 RLX Sport Hybrid interior serves as a \"gracious host\" for the driver and passengers, combining highly spacious five-passenger comfort with a higher level of luxury convenience and technology in an Acura flagship sedan. In the front seat area, a design concept called \"dual personal structure\" divides the space into areas centered on the driver and front passenger, complemented by a wide center stack and console that is easily accessible to each person. High-end premium elements, such as a carefully stitched leather instrument panel cover, soft-touch materials, premium finishes, and rich wood-grain accents, combine with an intuitive new control layout to create a distinctive environment in tune with this luxury performance sedan\'s sporting character.<br> <br> Open the door with the standard Smart Entry system and you\'ll find more shoulder room, front and rear. Rear seat leg room has been increased a substantial 2.5-inches, moving the RLX to the head of its class in tandem seating distance. Heated 12-way adjustable (8-way power plus 4-way power lumbar support) front seats are standard, and offer all-day comfort along with abundant lateral support for aggressive cornering.

The dual-hinged lid can be opened to the left or right, making access simple for either the driver or front-seat passenger. The glove box has a new electric release, and along with the audio, navigation and phone systems, can be easily locked via the touch screen - for situations where additional security is warranted, such as when RLX is given to a valet for parking.<br> <br> With the expanded range of standard and available technology features, substantial engineering effort was put into making each feature intuitive and easy to use. The focal point of the new instrument panel is a large 8-inch color audio/information screen that provides a range of useful information and access to an array of customizable features. When equipped with a navigation system, a high-resolution screen positioned in this same location combines audio, information and navigation functions.<br> <br> A 7-inch On-Demand Multi-Use Display™ positioned within easy reach of the driver and front passenger controls the audio system and many other features. The touchscreen eliminates many physical buttons, and is the key contributor to the clean, uncluttered look of the RLX interior. Dynamic menus clearly display controls for each functional mode, reduce screen clutter, and help make operation simple. Audible and touch feedback improves usability and control, and helps keep the driver\'s eyes on the road. Customizable shortcuts allow the RLX driver to set easy-to-access pre-sets for Places, Phone, Climate, Audio, and Valet functional categories.<br> <br> Befitting its flagship status in the Acura line, the RLX Sport Hybrid does not scrimp on thoughtful premium details. A power tilt/telescoping steering wheel with enhanced fingertip controls and a multi-view rearview camera are standard. Also standard are a two-driver memory system, auto-dimming rearview mirror, HomeLink®, Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW). To deliver excellent sound isolation, the RLX makes use of comprehensive sound deadening materials, an acoustic glass windshield, and an Active Sound Control system that helps cancel out interior noise. Acura Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® wireless telephone connectivity is also standard, and allows the RLX driver to dial a Bluetooth®-enabled mobile phone by voice command.<br> <br> Acura is known for its leadership in the adoption of advanced information and media technologies, and the 2014 RLX Sport Hybrid is no exception. The next generation of AcuraLink® delivers a broad spectrum of capabilities using both an embedded two-way cellular communication and cloud-based connectivity via the owner\'s compatible smart phone and data plan.

Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Blind Spot Information (BSI) system are standard. The RLX Sport Hybrid with Advance package adds standard Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low-Speed Follow, Lane Keeping Assist System, and front and rear parking sensors.<br> <br> Design and Materials<br> <br> The new RLX Sport Hybrid interior is a fresh take on premium luxury, with clean and elegant lines, high-end detailing, and intuitive functionality. A design concept called \"dual personal structure\" guided development, and divides the space into areas centered on the driver and front passenger, complemented by a wide center stack and console that is easily accessible to each person.<br> <br> With more on-board electronic features than ever before, the RLX designers rethought the user interface of the central stack, and developed a simple two-screen system. The 8-inch color audio/information screen is placed high in the instrument panel, where it\'s close to the driver\'s sight line. The lower, 7-inch touch screen eliminates the need for dozens of hard keys, and has contextual menus that make operation simple. The quality of interior materials, fit and finish have received close attention to reflect the discerning nature of the RLX owner, with stitched leather instrument panel detailing, available Milano leather seating, and soft-touch materials throughout.<br> <br> Driver-Oriented Cockpit<br> <br> Intuitive functionality has always been a priority in Acura design and is now a core element of Acura\'s focus on creating the synergy between man and machine - enabling the driver to focus on operating the vehicle rather than various controls. All important systems and controls are within easy reach of the driver. Controls for the systems used most frequently—audio, cruise control, Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink®, available satellite-linked Acura Navigation System with Voice Recognition™ and Multi-Information Display—are conveniently positioned on the steering wheel. The main instrumentation is an easy-to-read analog design, supplemented with digital and graphic displays. Even though the RLX gives its driver access to many electronic features, the interface is simple and welcoming. Sight lines are clear with important items placed within easy view.<br> <br> Typical of Acura interior design, the soft-touch switchgear of the RLX is engineered to deliver a quality feel and positive action. Helpful features, such as power side mirrors that can be set to automatically tilt-down when Reverse gear is engaged, make parking easier. A standard multi-view rearview camera provides a choice of three different views, displayed on the bright, colorful 8-inch audio/information screen.<br> <br> Leather-Wrapped Steering Wheel<br> <br> The leather-wrapped steering wheel with euro-style stitching incorporates the most commonly used controls, allowing the driver to keep their hands on the wheel. Phone and audio controls are on the left side; cruise control and multi-info display controls are on the right side, along with the switches for Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) and Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow on the Advance grade.<br> <br> Tucked out of view but within fingertip reach are a pair of paddle shifters that allow for manual operation of the Sequential SportShift 6-speed automatic transmission.<br> <br> Instrumentation<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid has sophisticated analog instrumentation with large tachometer and speedometer flanking a Multi-Information Display (MID) which provides a range of information and trip computer functions. The tachometer and speedometer are flanked by an analog coolant temperature and fuel level gauge.<br> <br> Head-Up Display<br> <br> The Acura RLX Sport Hybrid features the first application of Acura\'s new Head-Up Display, which utilizes a concave mirror located behind the instrument panel to project a broad range of information on the lower portion of the windshield directly in front of the driver.<br> <br> Display modes can be selected by a steering wheel-mounted thumb dial. Display modes include:<br> <br> Sport Hybrid SH-AWD system operation - displays the condition of each tire torque vectoring.<br> Tachometer - displays engine rpm, gear position and vehicle speed.<br> Navigation - turn-by-turn driving instructions are displayed in a birds-eye style format, accompanied by voice commands, along with vehicle speed.<br> Compass - indicates the direction of travel<br> ACC/LKAS - ACC: Recognition of the vehicle ahead LKAS: Lane markings<br> Speed only - displays vehicle speed<br> ACC/LKAS warnings - in the event of an unintentional lane departure (Lane Keep Assist) or impending collision (Collision Mitigation Brake System) the display will interrupt the selected mode to display the appropriate visual and audible warnings.<br> Additional automatic display content includes audio, speed-dial information and Voice Recognition<br> <br> Further, the driver can adjust the location of the projection (up and down) or turn off the system via switches on the instrument panel.<br> <br> Multi-Information Display<br> <br> A highly functional instrument panel gives the RLX driver instant access to critical information. It also provides important vehicle information via a Multi-Information Display (MID) positioned between the tachometer and speedometer. Controls positioned on the right side of the steering wheel allow the driver to cycle the MID display through multiple screens of information from sources including LKAS and ACC and more. The Maintenance Minder™ system alerts the RLX driver of upcoming maintenance needs via the MID and should a fault occur with the vehicle, specific warning information will appear.<br> <br> MID information categories include:<br> <br> Digital odometer and dual digital trip meters<br> Average fuel economy<br> Estimated remaining fuel range<br> Elapsed time<br> Average speed<br> Maintenance Minder™<br> Tire pressure monitoring system (TPMS)<br> Vehicle Settings customization<br> Engine oil life<br> Outside temperature<br> Instant fuel economy<br> Shift lever position<br> Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low-Speed Follow<br> Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS)<br> Turn-by-turn navigation (with Navigation package and up)<br> <br> Audio/Information Screen<br> <br> All RLX models feature a bright, full-color 8-inch audio/information screen positioned high in the center stack of the instrument panel. Its high placement puts it close to the driver\'s line of sight where it\'s easy to see. Besides audio system information, the screen also offers backup camera views and access to a range of customizable features.<br> <br> On-Demand Multi-Use Display™<br> <br> The impressive range of technology offered in the RLX presented designers with a challenge of balancing capability with simplicity. The solution came in the form of a 7-inch On Demand Multi-Use Display™ (ODMD) touch screen positioned within easy reach of the driver and front passenger. The touchscreen controls a wide range of features, and with its contextual menus, it displays relevant items while minimizing clutter. To make it easy to use, the screen offers audible and vibratory touch feedback—both can be adjusted or shut off based on the owner\'s preference. Customizable shortcuts allow the RLX driver to set easy-to-access presets for Places, Phone, Climate, Audio and Valet functional categories.<br> <br> The touchscreen display also provides access to the RLX\'s Valet Mode. Using the touch screen, the owner can assign a Personal Identification Number (PIN) that locks out the use of the trunk release and glove box, navigation system, audio system and phone.<br> <br> Multi-Angle Rearview Camera<br> <br> A multi-view rearview camera is standard on all grades. It offers three viewing angles (wide view, normal view and top view). Drivers may select the preferred view according to driving conditions. The rearview image is displayed on the 8-inch color audio/information display, or on the navigation system display (in the same location) on models equipped with navigation. On-screen guidelines help the driver better judge distances, and predictive guidelines help make maneuvering in reverse easier.<br> <br> One-Touch Turn Signals<br> <br> The RLX\'s one-touch turn signals provide increased convenience for the driver when making routine lane changes. In addition to normal operation, a quick movement of the turn signal lever (between 0.4 sec. and 1.0 sec.) will cause the turn signals to flash three times.<br> <br> Seating<br> <br> Considering the luxury mission and performance capabilities of the RLX, its seating required extensive engineering development. Detailed analysis of seats from competitive makes helped set engineering targets that balanced firm support, a feeling of secure stability when maneuvering, and the supple comfort required for all-day driving.<br> <br> An all-new internal structure (introduced in the RLX) lays the foundation for comfort. Specially compounded padding in four different densities is used strategically to blend support and comfort, with special firm inset pads positioned internally in the side bolsters for stable lateral support. Special attention was given to the Milano leather seat coverings to make for a soft touch, with the right amount of surface friction to help keep passengers securely in position while cornering.<br> <br> The driver and passenger front seats feature 12-ways of power adjustability (8-way power seat plus 4-way power lumbar support). The pneumatic lumbar support can be adjusted both longitudinally and vertically. All driver\'s seat power adjustments are included in the Smart Entry system that (among many other features). The system stores a pair of user profiles regarding seat settings—one for each of the two key fobs that come standard with the RLX Sport Hybrid.<br> <br> Heated front seats are standard in the RLX Sport Hybrid. Electronic control allows for three temperature settings, along with faster warm-up and smoother, more precise temperature control. Ventilated front seats and heated rear seats are standard in the Advance grade.<br> <br> The RLX offers rear seat occupants exceptional comfort and room. Specially sculpted front seat seatbacks generate extra leg room for rear seat passengers. In the rear seat area, the outer seating positions are carefully engineered (complete with side bolsters) to simultaneously combine solid lateral support with luxurious comfort on long trips.<br> <br> Interior Lighting<br> <br> The RLX theme of efficient driver control and easy-to-read components carries on after dark. The analog instruments are backlit with LED lighting and feature high-contrast markings. The gauge package progressively illuminates to give the driver a welcoming feel upon entry. When the door is first opened, the instrument lighting comes to life and then brightens progressively to 100-percent illumination when the ignition is switched on. The illuminated instrument panels then come alive, indicating that the car is ready to go. At the end of the drive, the instrument lighting dims progressively.<br> <br> All the interior switches and vent controls are illuminated to make them easy to locate at night, including the switches on all four doors and the steering wheel. In addition to front and rear overhead interior lights and map lights, the RLX also has a complement of low-level interior cabin lighting. Ambient lighting in the ceiling illuminates the front center console and the rear flip-down armrest. The front foot wells also have ambient lighting that brightens substantially when the doors are opened.<br> <br> Front and rear interior door handle areas are illuminated to make them easy to find at night, and the front door storage compartments, glove compartment, and center armrest compartment are all internally illuminated. All four doors have courtesy lights that illuminate when the doors are open. The RLX interior lights feature \"theater dimming,\" which can be set by the driver to one of several dimming rates via the Multi-Information Display. The trunk has interior lighting, plus the trunk lid has lighting that illuminates the bumper and sill area when the lid is opened.<br> <br> Interior Convenience<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid interior offers a range of storage and convenience features for the driver and passengers. The dual-hinged front center armrest incorporates a unique lid design that can flip open to the right or left, for conveniently accessing the center console storage compartment.<br> <br> A USB port inside the console allows for easy connectivity of items such as an iPod®, iPhone® or a removable flash drive storage device. The USB port is located alongside a traditional AUX jack that allows connectivity of an MP3 music player. Just ahead of the console, a pair of illuminated cupholders is conveniently positioned.<br> <br> Inside the glove compartment is a separate document box to accommodate the Owner\'s Manual as well as important registration and insurance papers. The separate document box arrangement not only keeps paperwork neatly contained, but it also frees up storage space in the main glove box compartment. In the rear seating area, a wide fold-down center armrest has a padded top. A pullout dual beverage holder is built into the rear armrest.<br> <br> Cargo Carrying Versatility<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid has a fully finished, 12.0 cubic-foot trunk (compared to 15.1 on the two-wheel drive RLX with Krell Audio and Advance packages). An underfloor storage compartment provides added space for small items. The acoustic properties of the trunk and the rear deck speakers were specially engineered to create the best possible sound performance from the three available audio systems. To allow room for longer items, a locking trunk pass-through is provided. A cargo net with a network of anchor points help keeps trunk cargo securely in position.<br> <br> For a cleaner appearance and to avoid damage to luggage, the trunk lid is supported by fully concealed hinge mechanisms. The trunk can be opened via a remote release mounted on the driver\'s door panel, by pulling the exterior release lever on the trunk lid (when carrying the Smart Entry keyless access fob), or with a manual release accessible through the locking trunk pass-through. There is also an emergency trunk opener, located near the trunk latch that can be found in total darkness thanks to a glow-in-the-dark yellow color treatment.<br> <br> GPS-Linked, Tri-Zone Automatic Climate Control<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid has GPS-linked temperature control, tri-zone automatic climate control system that lets the driver, front passenger and rear passengers set temperatures to their individual liking. Designed for exceptionally quiet operation the system also includes a selectable automatic recirculation mode that is controlled by an electronic control unit (ECU) and an air quality sensor.<br> <br> To operate the HVAC system, easy-to-read buttons and controls are positioned within easy reach. The HVAC system can also be controlled by voice command, and additional custom settings can be accessed through the 7-inch On-Demand Multi-Use Display™ interface. The climate control system\'s control logic is designed to provide smooth operation with subtle changes in airflow.<br> <br> With its position-sensing ability, the available GPS navigation system contributes to overall passenger comfort with a 3D solar sensing feature. Based on continuously updated vehicle position information, the navigation system determines the position of the sun relative to the driver and passenger. Combining this information with input from a solar sensor located on top of the instrument panel, the climate control system automatically adjusts the temperature and airflow from side to side as needed to compensate for asymmetrical solar heating.<br> <br> Rear Sunshades<br> <br> For increased rear seat privacy, reduced solar loading and greater passenger comfort on sunny days, the Advance grade RLX Sport Hybrid has a power operated rear-window sunshade along with manually operated expanded sunshades for each rear door side window.<br> <br> Active Noise Control (ANC) and Active Sound Control (ASC)<br> <br> Key contributors to the RLX Sport Hybrid\'s quiet, refined interior are Active Noise Control (ANC) and Active Sound Control (ASC). The two systems are comprised of dual overhead microphones, an ANC/ASC electronic processor, and the audio system\'s speakers. ASC/ANC operates whenever the RLX engine is running, even if the audio system is turned off.<br> <br> ANC is designed to reduce low frequency sound in the cabin caused mainly by the roughness of the road surface. The overhead microphones pick up sound waves and send them to the ANC/ASC processor, which creates and sends a precisely timed \"reverse phase\" audio signal to a special amplifier. In turn, the amplifier drives the door speakers to cancel the original noise signal.<br> <br> ASC is a related technology designed to improve the engine sound quality by making the sound pressure level more linear as the engine revs increase. Typically, engine noise doesn\'t increase in a linear way with rising revs; instead there can be many resonances that create peaks and valleys in the sound pressure level and an uneven sound. ASC helps smooth out the engine sound by creating a same-phase or reverse-phase sound signal as needed and sending it to the speakers. Though the system offers benefits from idle to redline, it makes the largest difference in the range between 1000 and 2000 rpm, where it lowers the sound pressure level with a reverse-phase audio signal.<br> <br> AcuraLink® Connectivity System<br> <br> The RLX launched the next generation of AcuraLink®, Acura\'s cloud-based connected car system that first launched in 2005. This new generation uses embedded cellular technology built into the RLX and RLX Sport Hybrid, along with the owner\'s compatible smartphone and data package, to bring a broad range of convenience, media and available security features to the RLX lineup.<br> <br> AcuraLink is the new center point for owners for hands-free access to cloud-based services, audio and information, and is designed to keep RLX drivers informed and connected while on the go. AcuraLink is available on both the RLX Sport Hybrid and RLX Sport Hybrid with Advance.<br> <br> The connectivity required for AcuraLink\'s various features is distributed between the RLX\'s embedded system (for some of the fee-based features) and the owner\'s compatible smartphone and data package (for free features).<br> <br> AcuraLink works with the owner\'s compatible smartphone and data package to connect the RLX with music and information resources, internet apps, and more. Aha™ by Harman is a key AcuraLink resource. Aha organizes the RLX owner\'s favorite content from the web into personalized on-demand radio stations in the vehicle. Aha is a comprehensive, cloud-based platform optimized for the automotive environment that provides a simple integration point for AcuraLink equipped vehicles to bring in a wide range of current and future applications into the audio system head unit. This new capability allows users to access their favorite podcasts, internet and terrestrial radio, on-demand music, restaurant recommendations via Yelp, and even audio updates from Facebook and Twitter.<br> <br> Owners can use the AcuraLink website to access information or change preferences. AcuraLink allows for Twitter and Facebook access.<br> <br> SMS Text Message Function<br> <br> All RLX models have a standard SMS Text Message function that can read incoming texts aloud over the audio system, and allow the driver to reply with any of six factory preset messages. The system works with SMS-capable cell phones that have an active data plan and the Message Access Profile (MAP), such as the Blackberry, Droid X and others. When running iOS6, an iPhone can receive text messages, but cannot send replies using the RLX interface.<br> <br> Once a compatible phone is paired with the RLX\'s Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® system, the text messaging function is enabled. When the phone receives a text message, an alert appears on the audio/information screen (or navigation screen in vehicles equipped with navigation). Using the audio system controls, the driver can choose to have the message read aloud, can select among the preset reply choices, or can call the sender - all without handling their phone. To help minimize driver distraction, the text of the incoming message is not displayed on-screen while the vehicle is moving.<br> <br> Available factory preset text replies:<br> <br> Talk to you later, I\'m driving<br> I\'m on my way<br> I\'m running late<br> OK<br> Yes<br> No<br> <br> Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® Wireless Telephone Interface<br> <br> Like all Acura vehicles, the RLX Sport Hybrid has a standard Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® hands free telephone interface that is designed to work with most Bluetooth®-enabled mobile phones. Bluetooth® is a radio frequency-based technology that allows portable devices (such as mobile cellular telephones, PDAs, and laptop computers) to communicate wirelessly. The RLX\'s HandsFreeLink® system is compatible with Bluetooth®-enabled cellular phones that have the Hands Free Profile (HFP). After the driver completes a one-time pairing process, the RLX can communicate wirelessly and securely with the driver\'s cell phone when it is within approximately 10 feet of the car. The phone needs to be on, but can be stored in a pocket, briefcase, purse, or anywhere inside the RLX cabin— thus there is no need to worry about where to place the cellular telephone.<br> <br> Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® allows the driver to send or answer telephone calls without removing their hands from the steering wheel. When a call comes in, the number of the incoming caller is displayed on the Multi-Information Display (MID) located in the instrument cluster. In addition, the phone ring tone is played over the audio system. If the driver chooses to answer the phone call, a press of the steering wheel-mounted \"Pick up\" button mutes the audio system and the incoming caller is heard over the RLX\'s audio system speakers. Working with an overhead array microphone, the HandsFreeLink® system helps cancel \"echo effect\" and reduces background noise to improve the transmission quality of the driver\'s speech.<br> <br> To send a call hands-free, the RLX driver can dial the number by voice, again using fingertip controls mounted on the steering wheel to activate the system. The driver also can store frequently called numbers in the system\'s memory using unique voice tags. Up to six different compatible mobile phones can be registered with the RLX\'s Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® system.<br> <br> Acura/ELS Studio® 14-Speaker Premium Audio<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid Technology grade features the Acura/ELS Studio® Premium Audio System, engineered specifically for the RLX by Panasonic and legendary recording engineer Elliot Scheiner to recreate the emotional experience you feel when you enjoy a live performance. The system\'s hardware matches the quality of recording studio equipment, and features high power amplification and advanced speaker technology. It includes a single-disc CD player, AM/FM/HD/XM/HDD and delivers detailed, well-balanced sound to all seating positions<br> <br> The system\'s 14 speakers are precisely located throughout the RLX cabin. Six titanium-domed tweeters are arrayed in the interiors; two near the A-pillars, two in the rear doors, and two more on the rear deck. A 3.1-inch super dynamic range speaker is centered in the top of the instrument panel, and six big 6.7-inch super-dynamic range speakers are placed in the door and on the rear deck. Finally, an 8-inch SLDD (Super Low Distortion Driver) subwoofer is position in the center of the rear deck.<br> <br> In addition to traditional source inputs, the RLX is fitted with a USB port that allows for easy connectivity to items such as an iPod® or iPhone® along with a removable flash drive storage device containing WMA, MP3 or AAC format music. The USB port is located alongside a traditional AUX jack (that allows connectivity of an external MP3 music player) located in the center console\'s storage compartment.<br> <br> Krell 14-Speaker Ultra-Premium Audio System<br> <br> The Acura RLX Sport Hybrid with Advance features a Krell audio system that is designed to set a new standard in automotive audio performance. Krell is one of the most highly respected names in high-end audio, with a three-decade history of developing ultra-premium home audio systems. Though the new RLX system marks Krell\'s first production automotive application, it shares the performance goals of all Krell systems: Musical detail, three-dimensional sound presentation, and extreme volume capability. Four years of development went into the RLX 14-speaker system.<br> <br> The 14 Krell speakers are positioned in the RLX cabin in the same locations as those in the Technology package. Six magnesium-domed tweeters are arrayed in the interior; two near the A-pillars, two more in the rear doors, and another pair on the rear deck. A 3.1-inch speaker is centered in the top of the instrument panel, and six large 6.7-inch Zylon® (Zylon® is a registered trade mark of Toyobo Co., Ltd. in Japan) speakers are placed in the doors and on the rear deck. Finally, an 8-inch subwoofer is positioned in the center of the rear deck.<br> <br> Krell uses highly advanced speaker technology to achieve a new level of audio performance. The tweeters, for example, use magnesium diaphragms. Reproducing high frequencies requires that the tweeter diaphragm be able to move extremely fast, so ideally the diaphragm should be constructed of materials with very low mass. Aluminum is lightweight, fairly rigid, and inexpensive, but an aluminum diaphragm structure has a strong inherent resonance of around 20 kHz. This resonance is often perceived as a harsh or gritty sound. Magnesium is more expensive than aluminum, but it has the benefit of being less mass. Adding a structural ridge to the diaphragm greatly increases rigidity without additional mass. This pushes the diaphragm\'s resonant frequency up into the inaudible 40 kHz range. The result is extraordinary detail and extended high frequencies without any trace of harshness.<br> <br> Special technology is also applied to the Krell system\'s six 6.7-inch speakers. The speakers use diaphragms constructed of a material called Zylon®, the world\'s strongest super-fiber. This very rigid material is ideal for speaker manufacturing. Zylon® responds very quickly to musical input and, more importantly, stops moving just as quickly when the musical signal stops. Compared to the polypropylene diaphragm material that is used in the vast majority of car audio speakers, Zylon® has far less unwanted vibration, resulting in a much cleaner and more detailed sound.<br> <br> Because of the ability of the magnesium tweeters and Zylon® speakers to reveal fine details in the music, the highest quality crossover components were required. Heavy gauge, pure copper inductors and top-of-the-line polypropylene capacitors from Bennic maintain perfect signal integrity.<br> <br> The discrete amplifier channels are designed exactly like the channels in a high-end Krell home amplifier. The main channels feature the same robust, high quality bipolar power transistors used in flagship Krell home amplifiers. The result is an amplifier that has one-third less distortion than amplifiers found in competing flagship luxury sedans. Using a class D channel for the subwoofer increases that amplifier\'s efficiency and reduces its size. The DirectFET class D amp is designed for low EMI (electro-magnetic interference) to keep the main output channels as noise-free as possible.<br> <br> For the best audio performance, the Krell system uses metal speaker grilles. Because metal is inherently stronger than the plastic used for most grilles, the grilles can have a more open area without compromising strength. Metal grilles also vibrate less than typical plastic grilles.<br> <br> Special care went into mounting the speakers with mounting plates that are thick and heavily reinforced. In combination with the specially engineered door panels, the mounting plates provide an extraordinarily rigid, stable mounting surface for each speaker element. Sound energy that would otherwise be wasted in the drive-unit or door vibration is accurately transmitted to the listener, resulting in tighter bass response and improved musical detail.<br> <br> XM® Radio<br> <br> XM® Radio is a standard feature within the RLX audio system and it provides more than 200 channels of digital programming with near CD-quality sound. The XM® signal is beamed to two broadcast satellites positioned in geostationary orbit above Earth. The beams from these two broadcast satellites combine to span the entire continental United States and some of Canada.<br> <br> XM® Radio programming includes channels devoted to music, sports, talk, traffic, weather, children\'s programming and entertainment. Of the more than 200 XM® channels, 71 are commercial-free. When the RLX\'s audio system plays XM® Radio, the Audio/Information screen (or navigation display in vehicles with navigation) displays the current category, station song title, or artist\'s name, while the current category and station are also displayed on the On-Demand Multi-Use Display™. A complimentary three-month subscription to the XM® Radio service is included with purchase of a new RLX, and customers are able to continue the service or cancel any time afterwards.<br> <br> HD Radio™<br> <br> All RLX models feature standard HD Radio™. HD Radio technology converts the traditional analog radio broadcast to digital and provides advanced audio and data features that enhance the listening experience. Sound quality is radically improved, and unlike satellite radio, HD Radio is free.<br> <br> Instead of sending out one analog signal, HD stations send out a bundled signal - both analog and digital. Because it is digital, textual data such as traffic, stock info and song titles can be sent out, as well. Unlike conventional radio, HD Radio stations broadcast extra channels, which are called HD2/HD3. These added channels offer RLX owners a universe of additional choices.<br> <br> Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Audio<br> <br> Hard Disk Drive (HDD) audio system featuring the 15GB HDD-based memory are programmed from the factory to copy music tracks from pre-recorded CDs, enabling customers to store many CDs worth of music on-board for easy access. The system will not copy music from burned CDs or from USB flash drives. Based on music files measuring an average size of 4.2MB per song at a 128kbps bit rate, approximately 3,500 songs can be loaded into the 15GB system (approximately 175 CDs).<br> <br> The HDD-based system records music at 6-times that of the original music track time. Two recording quality settings (192 kbps or 128 kbps) are available. The automatic-recording default setting can be changed to manual if desired.<br> <br> The audio system can display information about the music tracks, such as artist names and song titles using the Gracenote® database in the system software. This database can be periodically updated to reflect newly released music. Gracenote updates can be downloaded by RLX owners at automobiles.acura.com in the Ownerlink section (up to four updates per year maximum). The updates can then be loaded onto a CD-R or onto a USB thumb drive, which in turn can be used to update the RLX audio system. Even without a Gracenote update, newly released audio tracks will play on the sound system, without accompanying text information on genre, artist, album name and track name.<br> <br> Song By Voice®<br> <br> Song by Voice® is standard on the RLX Sport Hybrid. From most navigation screens, the driver can simply press the TALK button on the steering wheel. With so much audio content potentially available on the HDD or from an iPod, RLX engineers set out to make it easy to find content. So drivers can simply give a voice command, such as \"Play song \'Danny Boy,\'\" and the system will automatically begin playback. Song by Voice also lets the driver choose music by artist, album, track name, genre, playlist and even composer.<br> <br> Forward Collision Warning (FCW)<br> <br> The RLX Sport Hybrid features a new Forward Collision Warning (FCW) system as standard equipment. When the camera-based system detects a vehicle ahead and determines that collision is possible, it provides the driver with visual and audible alerts to encourage avoidance actions. The system does not include an automatic braking function.<br> <br> Lane Departure Warning (LDW)<br> <br> Lane Departure Warning (LDW), also standard, provides the driver with visual and audible alerts if the vehicle begins to move out of a detected lane without the turn signal activated. A button on the lower left portion of the instrument panel allows the system to be switched on and off.<br> <br> Smart Entry Keyless Access System<br> <br> The RLX features Acura\'s Smart Entry with Push Button Start. The Smart Entry system lets the RLX owner gain access to the vehicle without having to operate the key fob or conventional key. The Smart Entry remote has a unique digital identity and the RLX can be unlocked when the driver grabs one of the door handles (front doors only on the RLX and RLX with Navigation) while the remote is in his/her possession. When carrying the fob (or if all doors are unlocked), the trunk can be opened by pressing a button located on the RLX\'s rear fascia.<br> <br> Once the driver has opened the door and is seated, the Smart Entry system allows the RLX to be started by pushing the Engine Start/Stop button positioned on the instrument panel. When leaving the car, a press of the soft-touch button on the exterior door handle locks all the doors. Alternatively, pressing the Lock button on the Smart Entry remote will also simultaneously lock all doors.<br> <br> Smart Entry also features a unique \"quick vent\" feature. When the operator depressed the \"unlock\" button on the keyless remote for two seconds after unlocking the doors, the system lowers all four windows and opens the power moonroof to quickly vent built-up interior heat. In addition, by inserting the built-in key into the driver\'s door lock and holding the key in the \"lock\" position, all open windows can be simultaneously raised.<br> <br> Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow<br> <br> The Acura RLX Sport Hybrid Advance features Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low-Speed Follow. This vehicle speed and distance control system uses a grill-mounted millimeter-wave radar to monitor the distance between the RLX and the vehicle directly ahead. Like a conventional cruise control system, the ACC system can maintain a preset speed. In addition, by combining radar data with data from speed sensors, ACC can regulate the RLX\'s speed to maintain a preset following distance interval.<br> <br> The Low-Speed Follow feature can reduce the driver workload in congested traffic by maintaining a selected distance interval, even in stop and go traffic. If a vehicle detected ahead is in range of the system and slows to a stop, the RLX will also come to a stop. When the vehicle ahead moves forward, the vehicle icon on the multi-information display blinks. With a press of the RES/+/SET/- switch up or down, or with a press of the accelerator pedal, the RLX will resume Low-Speed Follow mode.<br>','[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURARLX-4726_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURARLX-4726_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURARLX-4726_3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURARLX-4726_4.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURARLX-4726_5.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_19.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_20.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_21.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_22.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_23.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_24.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_25.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_26.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_27.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_28.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_29.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_30.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_31.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_32.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_33.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_34.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_35.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_36.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_37.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_38.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_39.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_40.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_41.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_42.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_43.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_44.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_45.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_46.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_47.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_48.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_49.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_50.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_51.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_52.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_53.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_54.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_55.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_56.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_57.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_58.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_59.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_60.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_61.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_62.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_63.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_64.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_65.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_66.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_67.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_68.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_69.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_70.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_71.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RLX-4726_72.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/

generation of its flagship SUV, the MDX, in 2013 for the 2014 model year, and it was a total makeover compared to its predecessor.</strong></p><p></p><p>Since the market for three-row premium SUVs was increasing, the Japanese automaker tried to keep up with customers\' demands. So, in 2013 it unveiled the production version of this fourth-generation MDX at the New York International Auto Show. </p><p>The exterior looked more aggressive than before, with a diamond-shaped main grille above the bumper flanked by LED headlights and a pair of scoops. Thanks to its long hood and the cab-rearward profile, the MDX appeared sportier than before, even though it was mostly used for school runs or as a regular family hauler. At the back, the tailgate was slightly tilted forward, but the dynamic look was amplified by the D-pillar\'s and the third side windows\' shapes.</p><p>Acura worked hard to provide a more spacious interior compared to the MDX\'s third generation. Still, the room on the third row was not good enough for an average-sized adult but more than suitable for kids. In addition, with all three rows in place, the trunk could still provide 16.3 cu-ft (461 liters) of space. The automaker offered a unique feature in the segment, with a removable middle seat from the second row, thus transforming the interior into a six-seat affair and a clear passage to the rearmost bench seat. At the front, the bolstered seats fronted a dashboard that sported the infotainment screen atop the center stack.</p><p>Underneath the hood, Acura installed a 3.5-liter V6 with direct gasoline injection and paired it with a six-speed automatic. Power went to the front axle or in all corners.</p>','<strong>The 2014 MDX is the third generation of Acura\'s seven-passenger luxury performance SUV, the first to be developed from the ground up using an all-new, purpose-built platform (body and chassis) fully optimized for the needs of today\'s luxury SUV buyers.</strong><br> <br> The new Acura MDX, like its flagship sedan counterpart, the RLX, harnesses a host of Acura signature technologies to deliver on Acura\'s \"Synergy between Man and Machine\" product direction, and to offer higher levels of luxury, quietness, comfort and prestige in a vehicle that performs \"at the will of the driver\" with intuitive control and exhilarating dynamic performance.<br> <br> Developed on the image of an \"Executive Family Jet,\" the 2014 MDX is sleek and refined, prestigious and powerful, and designed to deliver on the unique performance and functional needs of the luxury SUV driver and passengers, be they kids or clients. In designing the new MDX, Acura engineers focused on three core values: class-leading fuel economy ratings; new levels of prestige and luxury comfort; and top-level safety performance. At the same time, they sought to further enhance the MDX\'s dynamic performance while maintaining its core appeal - the family-friendly, seven-passenger cabin and nimble, mid-size SUV exterior size and appearance.<br> <br> <strong>Packaging</strong><br> <br> For the 2014 MDX, the designers and engineers sought to further enhance the versatility and functionality of the vehicle\'s seven-passenger cabin while maintaining its relatively compact and sporting exterior shape.<br> <br> The 2014 MDX measures 2.0 inches longer than the previous-generation MDX and has a 2.8-inch longer wheelbase. Vehicle height has been lowered by 1.5 inches, and rear step-in height is lower by 1.8 inches compared to the outgoing model. The front track is 1.4 inches narrower and the rear wheel track is 1.2 inches narrower. The vehicle width is reduced by 1.3 inches. In this respect, the MDX presents a 2 percent smaller frontal area to the wind for improved aerodynamic efficiency, and a slightly narrower body for improved garage-ability, while the longer wheelbase helps to enhance ride quality and interior spaciousness. The passenger hip points in the first and second rows are lower by 1.2 inches and the third row is lower by 1.4 inches, improving the feeling of stability and reduced body roll for all occupants.<br> <br> Utilizing its longer wheelbase and new, more compact rear suspension, the 2014 MDX makes getting in and out of the back seats even easier with a 4.5-inch wider foot entry point and 1.8-inch lower step-in height. The second-row seats now have five-position reclining seatbacks, and a new Extended Slide feature provides 5.9 inches of total fore-aft seat travel, enabling greater flexibility in accommodating the needs of both second- and third-row passengers. With the middle-row seats in their rearward-most position, first- and second-row tandem seating distance has been lengthened by 1.1 inches, an ideal setting for traveling with four occupants, whether kids, clients or couples. A new One-Touch Walk-In feature makes for easier, more intuitive one-button operation of the second-row seats - from the rear seat, outboard middle row seats, or from outside the vehicle - further easing third-row entry and exit.<br> <br> Repackaging of the rear-seat HVAC system allowed for the creation of a large center console storage space, concealed beneath the sliding, leather-trimmed center armrest. About 2 inches deeper and wider, and almost 5 inches longer, the main compartment offers 2.5 times more volume than the previous model and is large enough to accommodate a moderately sized purse, a tablet computer and more. This is a key advantage of MDX in its class, where many competing models offer little or no center console storage space.<br> <br> Key packaging details and features:<br> <br> 2.8-inch longer wheelbase for improved cabin space and ride comfort<br> 2-percent smaller frontal area for greater aerodynamic efficiency<br> A minimum 1.2-inch lower hip point for all occupants aids sporty and stable feeling<br> 1.8-inch lower floor height for easier step-in<br> 4.5-inch wider foot entry point (between back of second-row seat bottom and rear wheelhouse inner) for improved third-row seat entry and exit.<br> New Extended Slide second-row seats provides a total of 5.9 inches of fore-aft seat travel<br> New One-Touch Walk-in feature for more intuitive and easy operation of second-row seats<br> Five-position reclining second-row seatbacks<br> New larger center console storage space.<br> <br> <strong>Platform</strong><br> <br> The 2014 Acura MDX is based on an all-new, purpose-built platform. Where previous generations of the MDX were developed from an existing Global Light Truck Platform, the 2014 MDX was completely redesigned and developed from the ground up.<br> <br> Tapping into their experience in developing the previous two generations of MDX, and using state-of-the-art computer modeling techniques, MDX engineers pursued a holistic vision for the new platform development, expanding the MDX\'s functional and dynamic performance envelope to achieve what are commonly conflicting goals - such as higher performance and class-leading fuel economy ratings; a more versatile and accommodating cabin and a significantly more aerodynamic body; and class-leading safety ratings and lower vehicle weight.<br> <br> This holistic approach to body development, included the strategic use of lightweight materials - such as 64-percent high-strength steel, aluminum and magnesium - resulted in a 275-pound reduction in overall vehicle weight compared to the previous model, aiding both fuel efficiency and dynamic performance. The MDX body also boasts a 16-percent gain in aerodynamic efficiency and a 19-percent reduction in vehicle running resistance. For improved dynamic response and better isolation of road noise and vibration, the 2014 MDX\'s torsional body rigidity is up 12.4 percent, and just as critically, the rigidity of suspension mounting points is up 67 percent versus the previous model.<br> <br> All-new suspension componentry - a new strut-type front suspension with triple-path damper mounting system, and a more compact and efficient multilink rear suspension - along with lighter and more rigid front and rear subframes, new hydraulic bushing mounts, and stiffer suspension mounting points contribute significantly to the MDX\'s ability to efficiently and effectively manage suspension loads for both outstanding ride comfort and confident, exhilarating driving performance. New Amplitude Reactive Dampers use variable damping rates to deliver outstanding ride compliance and responsive handling.<br> <br> The more compact rear multi-link suspension also eliminates the forward trailing arm of the previous system, which allowed engineers to lower the step-in height by 1.8 inches. In addition, the rear dampers now mount directly to the rigid rear frame, as opposed to the more flexible rear wheelhouse on the previous model, allowing for the use of softer bushing settings for better ride compliance without any sacrifice of handling performance. The MDX platform is also optimized for the new two-wheel-drive model by lowering the engine center by 1.2 inches, allowing for more horizontally oriented front drive shafts, which also helps reduce torque-steer tendencies under hard acceleration.<br> <br> The use of ultra-high-strength \"hot stamped\" steel for key body components includes the world\'s first one-piece stiffener ring for the driver and front passenger door areas, which along with the application of Acura\'s next-generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure, significantly enhances the ability to efficiently absorb and redirect crash energy in front and side impacts, and manage roof loads in the event of a rollover.<br> <br> Key platform details and features:<br> <br> 275-pound lower vehicle weight<br> 59-percent high-strength steel body (by weight)<br> Ultra high-strength steel, one-piece front door stiffener rings<br> Next-generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure<br> Acura\'s first three-piece magnesium steering hanger beam<br> Newly designed strut-type front suspension with triple-path damper mounting<br> More compact and efficient multi-link rear suspension<br> Stiffer, lighter front and rear suspension subframes with hydraulic bushings and suspension mounting points that are 67-percent more rigid<br> <br> <strong>Powertrain</strong><br> <br> The 2014 MDX utilizes the same Earth Dreams Technology engine architecture as the new RLX sedan, Acura\'s first direct-injected engine, incorporating a new i-VTEC valvetrain with two-stage Variable Cylinder Management™ (VCM™), the first application of VCM in an MDX. The MDX\'s engine architecture is also shared with two racecars that finished in first and second place, respectively, in the LMP2 class at the 12 Hours of Sebring endurance race in the 2013 American Le Mans Series. With a displacement of 3.5 liters, the aluminum, 24-valve V-6 engine produces 290 peak horsepower and 267 lb.-ft. of peak torque (both SAE net) with approximately 8 percent more torque below 2,750 rpm compared to the 3.7-liter engine in the previous model. Due to improved operating efficiency, horsepower output per liter is up 2 percent and torque output per liter is up 4.4 percent compared to the previous 3.7-liter engine.<br> <br> The 60-degree, aluminumV-6 engine is mated to a reengineered 6-speed automatic transmission with Sequential Sport Shift, reduced friction and smoother gear changes. On all-wheel drive models, power to the wheels is managed by Acura\'s Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD™) system, which automatically and instantaneously apportions engine torque between the front and rear axles and the left and right rear wheels to deliver confidence-inspiring handling and outstanding all-weather traction and control.<br> <br> Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) switches seamlessly between 3- and 6-cylinder modes, depending on engine load, effectively varying engine displacement to match driving conditions for improved fuel efficiency. Active Control engine Mounts (ACM) and Active Noise Cancellation allow the VCM system to operate in 3-cylinder mode across a wider range of driving situations.<br> <br> Key powertrain details and features:<br> <br> All-new direct injected 3.5-liter 24-valve V-6<br> i-VTEC® valvetrain with Variable Cylinder Management™ (VCM®)<br> Computer-controlled Direct Injection (DI) with multi-hole fuel injectors<br> Reengineered 6-speed automatic transmission with Sequential Sport Shift<br> Available Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD)<br> Active Control Engine Mounts (ACM) and Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)<br> Grade Logic Control System reduces gear \"hunting\" on steep grades<br> <br> <strong>Dynamic Performance</strong><br> <br> The second-generation MDX is highly regarded for its exhilarating handling and spirited driving performance. The 2014 MDX further expands the MDX\'s dynamic performance envelope with quicker acceleration, shorter stopping distances and more nimble handling, in combination with increased fuel efficiency and enhanced ride comfort.<br> <br> Taking full advantage of its Earth Dreams Technology powertrain, all-new chassis, and lighter and more rigid body, the MDX is quicker and more responsive in virtually every respect. A fatter torque curve - with 8 percent more torque available below 2,750 rpm - improves the new MDX\'s launch performance and low-end grunt. The Sequential Sport Shift automatic transmission features Normal and Sport modes and provides for full manual control of gear changes via the steering wheel-mounted paddle shifters.<br> <br> A larger diameter steering column shaft combined with a new Electric Power Steering (EPS) system delivers highly responsive steering with better on-center feel and improved damping of unwanted road vibrations transmitted to the steering wheel. The steering ratio on the new MDX is also 9-percent quicker than on the preceding model.<br> <br> The new 2014 MDX SH-AWD delivers a one-half-second quicker 0-60 mph time, a shorter 60-0 mph stopping distance, and higher maximum lateral g-force versus the previous SH-AWD model. Further, the new MDX turns an 8-second faster lap time on Germany\'s grueling Nürburgring Nordschleife (North Ring) where both the previous and new versions of the MDX were extensively tuned and tested. Additional testing and tuning, particularly for the new vehicle\'s 6-speed transmission, was performed on German autobahns and the Grossglockner Pass in the Austrian Alps.<br> <br> To meet the varying needs of every driver in the family, the new MDX incorporates a new Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) with three driving modes - Comfort, Normal and Sport. In Normal mode, the steering effort is balanced between comfortable and sporty. Selecting the Comfort mode reduces steering effort for low-effort maneuverability, especially at low speeds and when maneuvering in tight spaces. The Sport mode provides a firmer steering feel with higher effort that complements more aggressive open-road driving. Sport mode also adjusts throttle response and SH-AWD torque proportioning, and even Active Noise Control for a more aggressive engine note in the cabin.<br> <br> Standard on the MDX, Agile Handling Assist, a signature Acura technology, selectively uses the vehicle\'s brakes to improve corner traceability and confident handling feel, using brake torque to create a body yaw, or turning moment at corner entry. The 2014 MDX also comes standard with 4-channel anti-lock brakes, and Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) for enhanced stability and control in all driving and road conditions.<br> <br> Key performance details and features:<br> <br> All-new 290-horsepower 3.5-liter i-VTEC direct-injected 24-valve V-6<br> Available Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD)<br> Sequential Sport Shift automatic transmission<br> One-half second quicker 0-60 mph<br> 8 seconds faster lap time on Germany\'s Nürburgring Nordschleife<br> 8 percent more low-end torque (below 2,750 rpm)<br> Advanced shift-hold control limits up-shifts during spirited driving<br> More lightweight and rigid body and suspension subframes<br> New, more efficient front strut with triple-path damper mounting<br> New multi-link rear suspension<br> Larger diameter steering column shaft<br> Electric Power Steering (EPS) with 9-percent quicker steering ratio<br> Amplitude Reactive Dampers, front and rear<br> Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) for customizable dynamic performance<br> New Agile Handling Assist for improved corner traceability<br> 4-channel Anti-Lock Brakes (ABS) with Electronic Brake Distribution and Brake Assist<br> Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA)<br> <br> <strong>Fuel Efficiency</strong><br> <br> The 2014 MDX with SH-AWD has a remarkable 17-percent increase in its combined EPA fuel economy rating versus the previous model, to class-leading levels (18/27/21 mpg city/highway/combined), while the new two-wheel-drive MDX is EPA rated at 20/28/23 mpg, a 28-percent increase in combined fuel economy versus the previous SH-AWD model (the only drivetrain configuration previously available).<br> <br> Realizing this large of an increase in fuel economy ratings while meeting other critical objectives, such as top-level safety, improved dynamic performance and enhanced refinement, was made possible by the development of the new MDX platform and the resulting improvements in vehicle mass (weight down), driveline efficiency, and vehicle running resistance. As previously stated, the 2014 MDX is 275 pounds lighter than the model it replaces. Further, its all-new Earth Dreams Technology i-VTEC 24-valve V-6 engine features more efficient fuel combustion via direct injection, reduced engine friction, and the first application of Variable Cylinder Management technology to the MDX.<br> <br> In addition to its lighter body and fuel-efficient powertrain, the new Acura MDX is optimized in every respect to reduce total running resistance or \"road load,\" consisting of engine pumping losses, driveline friction, aerodynamic drag and tire rolling resistance. The MDX is the first Acura model to be developed using a new 40-percent-scale wind tunnel laboratory at the company\'s U.S. R&amp;D facilities in Ohio. Through the use of the new wind tunnel with rolling ground plane and sophisticated computer modeling techniques, engineers were able to optimize the vehicle design - not only the upper body, but also the underbody as well as efficient airflow through the engine compartment - to achieve a 16 percent improvement in the new MDX\'s coefficient of drag to class-leading levels.<br> <br> Total vehicle running resistance is also reduced 19 percent versus the outgoing model. In addition to improvements in powertrain efficiency and vehicle aerodynamics, key engineering features for reduced running resistance include new low-drag brakes (70 percent less drag versus the previous model), a new lightweight, low-drag hub and wheel bearing design, and reduced-rolling-resistance tires. The result is more efficient and effortless cruising efficiency - a tremendous example of Acura\'s smart approach to fuel efficiency. A low-profile 19.5-gallon fuel tank aids airflow and maintains the MDX\'s excellent highway driving range.<br> <br> Key fuel efficiency details and features:<br> <br> 3.5-liter direct-injected i-VTEC V-6 with Variable Cylinder Management (VCM)<br> Active Noise Control and Active Engine Mounts improve VCM operating range<br> 17 percent increase in combined fuel economy rating on models with SH-AWD<br> 275 pound reduction in total vehicle weight<br> 16 percent lower coefficient of drag<br> 19 percent less running resistance<br> Low profile, 19.5-gallon fuel tank<br> Low-drag brakes<br> Light weight, low drag hub and wheel bearings<br> Lighter weight rear brake pistons<br> <br> <strong>Luxury Quiet, Comfort and Convenience</strong><br> <br> In considering their mission to develop the third-generation Acura MDX, designers and engineers conducted in-depth research with existing MDX customers and owners of competing products. One major opportunity for improvement identified by the team was the overall level of refinement, in particular cabin noise that can interfere with conversations between vehicle occupants, or during hands-free cellphone conversations, and detracts from the feeling of a luxury driving experience. In addition, designers saw an opportunity to further enhance the MDX\'s level of luxury comfort and prestige with respect to interior materials, features and function. The resulting effort to improve overall refinement is the 2014 MDX - the quietest, most composed and luxurious MDX ever.<br> <br> In fact, the engineering team developed new methods for testing ambient cabin noise and performance, including a new test mode in which the vehicle cabin is pressurized and tested for paths of sounds transmission. This and other tests led to the application of new materials, such as expanded foam in the roof pillars; new pillar separators (located at the bottom of each pillar); and new insulating materials for the rear wheelhouse, rear cargo floor and rear quarter panel. A new floor \"sealing plane\" further dampens road noise. The 2014 MDX also applies thicker, three-layer acoustic glass for the windshield and front side windows, thicker rear door glass, new triple seal side-sill door seal, and Active Noise Control technology to mitigate low-frequencies associated with the VCM system during three-cylinder operation.<br> <br> The MDX\'s more rigid body, subframes and suspension mounting points, along with a new triple-path front damper mounting system, and a high frequency wheel design further enhance ride comfort and vibration damping, particularly for second- and third-row passengers. A more rigid, steering column shaft replaces the previous two-piece column and rubber bushing to greatly reduce the transmission of road vibrations through the steering wheel while providing improving on-center feel and responsive handling performance.<br> <br> To realize a higher level of interior luxury, designers applied high quality, soft touch materials throughout the cabin. LED backlit gauges with progressive illumination have the appearance of a high-end chronograph. LED lamps are also used for cabin accent lighting on the center console and front foot wells, which also feature progressive illumination and are programmable (the dimming time can be programmed) through the vehicle\'s Multi-Information Display. Premium Milano leather is used on the first and second-row seating surfaces, and satin chrome plated trim and simulated wood-grain accents highlight the upscale cabin. The leather-wrapped steering wheel also features new, smoother Euro-style stitching.<br> <br> The MDX with Advance and Entertainment Package features heated/ventilated front seats and heated rear seats that are electronically linked to the vehicle\'s climate control system. The synced system allows the cabin to more quickly reach the user set cabin temperature.<br> <br> The MDX has standard Smart Entry Keyless Access System with front and rear hatch access. On the Technology Package and above, Smart Entry access is also added to the rear passenger doors. Advance and Entertainment Packages offers remote engine start that can be activated with a range of at least 300 feet from the vehicle, allowing the vehicle to be pre-heated or pre-cooled and defrosted/defogged based on the customer\'s preselected settings. Accessory Engine Remote start is available for any grade (pre-wired). Also standard on Technology and Entertainment Packages and above grades are new (manually operated) rear side-window shades.<br> <br> The rear cargo area has been further refined on the 2014 MDX, with a new, fully-sealed spindle-type tailgate opening mechanism that presents a cleaner, less cluttered appearance. The trailing edge of the rear cargo floor features dual brushed aluminum trim plates for a more finished appearance, while also offering protection during the loading and unloading of goods.<br> <br> Additional standard and available luxury comfort and convenience features on the 2014 MDX include push-button start, Multi-Angle Rearview Camera, One-Touch turn signals (all standard); rain-sensing wipers (Technology Package and above); and front and rear parking sensors and auto-dimming side mirrors (Advance and Entertainment Packages).<br> <br> Key luxury comfort details and features:<br> <br> Smart Entry Keyless Access System<br> 3-layer acoustic windshield and front door glass<br> Thicker rear door glass<br> Expanded foam in roof pillars<br> Noise-insulating pillar separators<br> New floor sealing plane<br> Triple-path front damper mounting<br> New cabin noise test methodology<br> New, more efficient multi-link rear suspension<br> LED gauge cluster and cabin accent lighting with progressive illumination<br> Standard leather seating surfaces<br> Euro-stitched leather-wrapped steering wheel<br> Heated steering wheel (optional)<br> One-touch turn signals<br> Heated front seats<br> Heated rear seats (Technology and Entertainment Packages and up)<br> Ventilated front seats (Advance and Entertainment Packages)<br> Rain sensing wipers (Technology Package)<br> Puddle lights (Technology Package)<br> Rear door window sunshades (Technology and Entertainment Packages and up)<br> Perforated Milano premium leather seating surfaces (Advance)<br> Auto dimming side mirrors (Advance and Entertainment Packages)<br> <br> <strong>Advanced Connectivity and Entertainment</strong><br> <br> Acura customers have high expectations for state-of-the-art connectivity and entertainment. Enhanced connectivity in the 2014 MDX is made possible by the next-generation AcuraLink® system, which offers thousands of media options via Aha™ mobile, all delivered via the owner\'s internet-linked smartphone and data plan. There is also a host of new available security and convenience features, including collision notification, remote unlocking, stolen vehicle tracking and surface street traffic information, all delivered via built-in cell technology (in some instances, a subscription fee applies).<br> <br> The new MDX will thrill audiophiles with its available music entertainment features. The 2014 MDX comes with an 8-speaker, 432-watt (up from 253 watts) audio system featuring a single-disc CD player, AM/FM/SiriusXM radio bands, and standard USB connector. The MDX with Technology Package features a 10-speaker, 501-watt Acura/ELS® Studio system, also with a single-disc CD player and AM/FM/SiriusXM radio plus HD Radio™ and 16-gigabytes of Hard Disk Drive (HDD) media storage. The MDX with Technology and Entertainment Packages features an Acura/ELS® Studio 11-Speaker Audio System with a new ceiling-mounted speaker and a 529-watt amplifier, along with all the features listed above. The MDX with Advance and Entertainment Packages features an Acura/ELS® Studio 12-Speaker Audio System with new ceiling-mounted speakers and a 546-watt amplifier, along with all the features listed above.<br> <br> Additional standard features on all models includes Pandora® interface, Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® hands free telephone interface, and an SMS Text Message function that can read incoming texts aloud over the audio system and allow the driver to reply with any of six factory preset messages (using a compatible smartphone and data plan).<br> <br> The available Entertainment Package adds a DVD Rear Entertainment system with a ceiling-mounted 9-inch full VGA screen, while the top of the line MDX Advance and Entertainment Packages features a new ultra-wide 16.2-inch full WVGA screen - the largest and highest resolution screen ever offered in an Acura vehicle.

Further, the new MDX features the world\'s first ultra-high strength \"hot stamped\" steel, one-piece stiffener ring for the driver and front passenger front door areas - comprised of the A- and B-pillar, roof rail and lower frame member - to improve crash energy management in frontal offset and side impact collisions as well as roof crush load management.<br> <br> The MDX also employs a new driver\'s knee airbag, as well as driver- and front-passenger front airbags, driver- and front-passenger side airbags, and three-row side curtain airbags with a wider deployment profile to mitigate passenger ejection in a rollover. The Advance and Entertainment Packages adds driver- and front-passenger seatbelts with e-pretensioners. The 2014 MDX also features LATCH child-seat anchors in all second-row seating.<br> <br> Other advanced safety technologies include Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Forward Collision Warning (FCW) on Technology Package and above grades, and the Collision Mitigation Brake System (CMBS) on the Advance and Entertainment Package.<br> <br> Apart from those safety technologies, for enhanced visibility and road awareness, the MDX employs a range of new driver-assistive technologies, including standard Expanded View Driver\'s Mirror and Multi-Angle Rearview Camera; Blind Spot Information (BSI) system ) on Technology Package and above grades; and Lane Keep Assist (LKAS) and Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow on the Advance and Entertainment Packages. These systems are designed to operate intuitively and with a minimum of driver manipulation, while aiding the driver and his/her ability to operate their vehicle with increased confidence and situational awareness.<br> <br> Key safety details and features:<br> <br> Anticipated Five-Star NCAP Overall Vehicle Score<br> Anticipated TOP SAFETY PICK+ IIHS safety rating<br> Next-generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure<br> World\'s first ultra-high strength steel, one-piece front door stiffener ring<br> Pre-tensioning driver and front passenger seatbelts<br> Driver\'s knee airbag and three-row side-curtain airbags<br> LATCH child seat anchors in all second row seating positions<br> Available Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Forward Collision Warning (FCW)<br> Available Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS)<br> Key visibility and driver assistive technologies:<br> Expanded View Driver\'s Mirror<br> Multi-View Rear Camera<br> Available Blind Spot Information (BSI)<br> Available Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS)<br> Available Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow<br> Available Front and rear parking sensors (4 front/4 rear)<br> <br> <strong>POWERTRAIN</strong><br> <br> An all-new 3.5-liter direct injected i-VTEC® 24-valve V-6 engine, rated at 290 peak horsepower and 267 lb.-ft. peak torque (both SAE net), powers the 2014 MDX. This is the second application of Earth Dreams Technology (following the 2014 RLX sedan) comprised of a next-generation family of powertrain technologies that greatly enhance both driving performance and fuel efficiency.<br> <br> Compared to the 3.7-liter engine it replaces, the 3.5-liter V-6 in the 2014 MDX offers an 8 percent increase in torque at engine speeds below 2,750 rpm for greater overall responsiveness. Together with the 2014 MDX\'s 275-lb. reduction in curb weight, overall performance is enhanced, including quicker 0-60 mph times and 8-second-faster laps of Germany\'s Nürburgring Nordschleife (North Loop) compared to the outgoing model.<br> <br> The new direct-injected engine contributes to the MDX\'s substantially improved EPA-estimated fuel economy ratings - The SH-AWD version of the MDX improved city ratings by 12.5-percent, highway ratings by 28.6-percent, and combined ratings by 17-percent. The 2014 MDX with front-wheel drive fuel economy ratings feature a 28-percent increase in combined mpg, achieving 20 city/28 highway/23 combined, versus the 2013 model with SH-AWD (the only type previously offered). The MDX also meets the stringent ULEV-2 California Air Resources Board (CARB) emissions rating. No other vehicles in the MDX\'s competitive set offer a comparable combination of power and fuel economy ratings.<br> <br> The 2014 MDX\'s new direct-injected V-6 precisely places fuel into each combustion chamber for better combustion and greater overall efficiency. The MDX engine also incorporates a range of advanced friction-reducing technologies that help boost fuel efficiency and power output. A new crossflow magnesium intake manifold, special \"tumble\" type intake ports, new piston-crown shapes, and an elevated 11.5:1 compression ratio are keys to the MDX\'s blend of power and fuel efficiency.<br> <br> A new generation of i-VTEC® (intelligent Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) for the intake valves is now combined with Variable Cylinder Management™ (VCM®) for the first time ever in the MDX. VCM adjusts the working displacement of the engine to match the driving requirements from moment to moment. During startup, aggressive acceleration or when climbing hills - when high power output is required - the engine operates on all six cylinders. During moderate speed cruising and at low or moderate engine loads, the system operates just the front bank of three cylinders. Since the system automatically closes both the intake and exhaust valves on the rear bank of three cylinders, pumping losses from air intake and exhaust are eliminated and fuel efficiency gets a further boost.<br> <br> The Earth Dreams Technology 3.5-liter V-6 is teamed with a Sequential SportShift 6-speed automatic transmission with racing-inspired shift paddles located on the steering wheel. The transmission offers two automatic modes (Drive and Sport), or the paddle shifters can be used for full manual operation of the transmission for maximum control and driving engagement.<br> <br> For the first time, the MDX is available in both all-wheel-drive (SH-AWD) and front-wheel-drive layouts. With its high efficiency and lighter weight, the front-wheel drive MDX has enhanced fuel economy ratings. The MDX is also available with Acura\'s acclaimed Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®), which progressively distributes torque not only between the front and rear axles, but also between the left and right rear wheels. Using torque vectoring to help turn the vehicle, SH-AWD® creates a more responsive, neutral and predictable platform while providing outstanding all-weather confidence and control.<br> <br> <strong>Engine Architecture</strong><br> <br> The MDX 3.5-liter VTEC® V-6 has a die-cast lightweight aluminum alloy block with cast-in-place iron cylinder liners, a smooth-firing 60-degree V-angle, and compact overall dimensions. As in the 2014 Acura RLX, the MDX powerplant combines Direct Injection with i-VTEC and Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) to give the MDX impressive fuel economy ratings and overall performance. This clean-running engine meets ULEV-2 emissions standards in select states, and Federal Tier 2, Bin 5 standards.<br> <br> A wide range of improvements, including revised intake and exhaust ports and updated valve timing, help make the 3.5-liter V-6 nearly as powerful as the 3.7-liter engine it replaces. Due to greater operating efficiency, the engine\'s horsepower per liter has risen by 2 percent and torque has been increased by 4.4 percent per liter. The aluminum-alloy 24-valve engine now produces 290 horsepower at 6,200 rpm and generates 267 lb-ft of torque at 4,500 rpm. Torque has improved up to 8 percent at engine speeds below 2,750 rpm, aiding the MDX\'s responsiveness.<br> <br> The updated V-6 contributes to a 28.6-percent increase in the EPA highway fuel economy rating of the 2014 MDX with SH-AWD and a 33.3-percent increase in models with front wheel drive, versus the 2013 MDX SH-AWD (the only drivetrain available in the previous model).<br> <br> This enhanced efficiency is due to a range of engineering features, including internal friction reduction, an oil-ring ion-plating treatment, plateau honing, low-friction 0W-20 engine oil, and reduced auxiliary-belt tension. A new tumble-type intake port design improves combustion efficiency, and torque-converter function in the standard 6-speed automatic transmission has been refined.<br> <br> <strong>Engine Block and Crankshaft</strong><br> <br> With its 60-degree V-angle, the MDX\'s V-6 engine is inherently smooth and has compact overall dimensions that allow efficient packaging within the vehicle. The V-6 has a die-cast lightweight aluminum alloy block with cast-in-place iron cylinder liners. Made with a centrifugal spin-casting process, the thin-wall liners are high in strength and low in porosity. The block incorporates a deep-skirt design with four bolts per bearing cap for rigid crankshaft support and minimized noise and vibration. The 3.5-liter V-6 uses a high-strength steel crankshaft for minimum weight.<br> <br> A cooling control spacer positioned in the water jacket surrounding the cylinders helps control warm-up and operating cylinder liner temperatures to reduce friction. Plateau honing of the cylinder lining further reduces friction between the piston skirts and the cylinder walls by creating an ultra-smooth surface. This two-stage machining process uses two grinding processes instead of the more conventional single-stage honing process. Plateau honing also enhances the long-term wear characteristics of the engine.<br> <br> <strong>Pistons/Connecting Rods</strong><br> <br> Designed with \"cavity-shaped\" crowns, the 2014 Acura MDX engine\'s pistons help maintain stable combustion and contribute to stratified-charge combustion. Ion-plated piston rings help reduce friction for greater operating efficiency. The compression ratio (relative to the 2013 MDX 3.7-liter engine) has risen from 11.2:1 to 11.5:1. Heavy-duty steel connecting rods are forged in one piece and then the crankshaft connecting rods are \"crack separated\" to create a lighter and stronger rod with an optimally fitted bearing cap.<br> <br> <strong>Cylinder Heads/Valvetrain</strong><br> <br> Like other Acura V-6 powerplants, the MDX engine\'s 4-valve cylinder heads are a single-overhead-camshaft design, with the cams driven by the crankshaft via an automatically tensioned toothed belt. Made of low-pressure cast, low-porosity aluminum, each cylinder head incorporates a new \"tumble port\" design that improves combustion efficiency by creating a more homogeneous fuel-air mixture. An integrated exhaust manifold cast into each cylinder head reduces parts count, saves weight, improves flow and optimizes the location of the close-coupled catalyst.<br> <br> <strong>i-VTEC with 2-Stage Variable Cylinder Management™ (VCM®)</strong><br> <br> The MDX SOHC V-6 combines Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) with Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (i-VTEC), which changes the lift profile, timing and lift duration of the intake valves. A switching mechanism allows each cylinder to operate with low-rpm valve lift and duration or high-rpm lift and duration. The rear cylinder bank\'s valve gear closes all intake and exhaust valves to minimize pumping losses while operating in three-cylinder mode.<br> <br> The \"intelligent\" portion of the system is its ability to vary valve operation based on the driving situation and engine rpm. At low rpm, the i-VTEC intake valve timing and lift are optimized (low lift, short duration) for increased torque, which allows a wide range of 3-cylinder operation. As engine rpm builds past 4,950 rpm, the i-VTEC system transitions to a high-lift, long-duration intake cam profile for superior high-rpm engine power.<br> <br> <strong>VCM Operation</strong><br> <br> To help improve the fuel efficiency of the MDX engine, a new variation of Acura\'s Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) is used. The VTEC system combines with Active Control engine Mounts (ACM) to allow the VCM system to operate with three cylinders in a wide range of situations to maximize fuel efficiency and lower emissions. When greater power is needed, the system switches seamlessly to six cylinder operation.<br> <br> During startup, aggressive acceleration, or steep ascents - any time high power output is required - the engine operates on all six cylinders. During moderate-speed cruising and at low or moderate engine loads, the system operates just the front bank of three cylinders.<br> <br> The VCM system can tailor the working displacement of the engine to match the driving requirements from moment to moment. Since the system automatically closes both the intake and exhaust valves of the cylinders that are not used, pumping losses associated with intake and exhaust are eliminated and fuel efficiency gets a further boost. The system combines maximum performance and maximum fuel efficiency - two characteristics that don\'t typically coexist in conventional engines.<br> <br> VCM deactivates specific cylinders by using the i-VTEC (intelligent Variable Valve-Timing and Lift Electronic Control) system to close the intake and exhaust valves while the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) simultaneously cuts fuel to those cylinders. The spark plugs continue to fire in inactive cylinders to minimize plug temperature loss and prevent fouling induced from incomplete combustion during cylinder re-activation.<br> <br> The system is electronically controlled, and uses special integrated spool valves in the cylinder heads. Based on commands from the system\'s Electronic Control Unit, the spool valves selectively direct oil pressure to the rocker arms for specific cylinders. This oil pressure in turn drives synchronizing pistons that connect and disconnect the rocker arms.<br> <br> The VCM system monitors throttle position, vehicle speed, engine speed, automatic-transmission gear selection and other factors to determine the correct cylinder activation scheme for the operating conditions. In addition, the system determines whether engine oil pressure is suitable for VCM switching and whether catalytic-converter temperature will remain in the proper range. To further smooth the transition of activating or deactivating cylinders, the system adjusts ignition timing and throttle position and turns the torque converter lock-up on and off. As a result, the transition between three and six cylinder modes is effectively unnoticeable to the driver.<br> <br> <strong>Direct Injection System</strong><br> <br> The Acura MDX\'s V-6 engine is the second application of direct injection for an Acura vehicle in the United States, following the 2014 RLX sedan. The system features a compact, high-pressure, direct-injection pump that allows both high fuel flow and pulsation suppression, while variable pressure control optimizes injector operation. A multi-hole injector delivers fuel directly into each cylinder (not to the intake port, as in conventional port fuel injection designs), allowing for more efficient combustion.<br> <br> The multi-hole injectors can create the ideal stoichiometric fuel/air mixture in the cylinders for good emissions control. Theoretically, a stoichiometric mixture has just enough air to completely burn the available fuel. Based on the operating conditions, the direct-injection system alters its function for best performance. Upon cold engine startup, fuel is injected into the cylinders on the compression stroke. This creates a weak stratified charge effect that improves engine start-up and reduces exhaust emissions before a normal operating temperature is reached.<br> <br> Once the engine is fully warmed up for maximum power and fuel efficiency, fuel is injected during the intake stroke. This helps create a more homogeneous fuel/air mix in the cylinder that is aided by the high-tumble intake port design. This improves volumetric efficiency, and the cooling effect of the incoming fuel improves anti-knock performance.<br> <br> <strong>Active Control Engine Mounts and Active Sound Control</strong><br> <br> A new, more powerful 28-volt Active Control Engine Mount system (ACM) is used to minimize the effects of engine vibration as the VCM system switches cylinders on and off. The 28-volt ACM is a key factor in the VCM\'s broad range of operation in the new MDX. Sensors alert the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to direct ACM actuators positioned at the front and rear of the engine to cancel engine vibration using a reverse-phase motion. In the cabin of the MDX, an Active Sound Control (ASC) system further mitigates low frequencies that can occur during three-cylinder operation.<br> <br> There are two different Active Sound Control profiles available in the MDX. When the Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) is in the Normal or Comfort setting, the ASC is tuned for maximum interior quietness. When the IDS Sport mode is selected, the ASC allows a more aggressive interior engine note.<br> <br> <strong>Drive-by-Wire Throttle System</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s Drive-by-Wire throttle system replaces a conventional throttle cable with smart electronics that \"connect\" the accelerator pedal to a throttle valve inside the throttle-body. The result is less underhood clutter and lower weight, as well as quicker and more accurate throttle actuation. Plus, a specially programmed \"gain\" rate between the throttle pedal and engine offers improved drivability and optimized engine response to suit specific driving conditions.<br> <br> Acura\'s Drive-by-Wire throttle system establishes the current driving conditions by monitoring throttle pedal position, throttle valve position, engine speed (rpm) and road speed. This information is used to define the throttle control sensitivity that gives the MDX\'s throttle pedal a predictable and responsive feel that meets driver expectations.<br> <br> There are two different throttle profiles available in the MDX. When the Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) is in the Normal or Comfort setting, the transmission is in \"D\" (Drive) the drive-by-wire system uses the normal profile. When the Sport mode is selected, the system switches to a more aggressive throttle map to enhance responsiveness.<br> <br> <strong>Direct Ignition and Detonation/Knock Control</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s Electronic Control Unit (ECU) monitors engine functions to determine the best ignition spark timing. Two engine block-mounted acoustic detonation/knock sensors \"listens\" to the engine, and based on this input, the ECU can retard the ignition timing to prevent potentially damaging detonation. The 3.5-liter V-6 has an ignition coil unit for each cylinder that is positioned above each spark plug\'s access bore.<br> <br> <strong>Close-Coupled Catalysts</strong><br> <br> The exhaust manifolds of the 3.5-liter V-6 are cast directly into the aluminum cylinder heads to reduce weight, decrease parts count, and create more underhood space. The result of this casting design is that the two primary catalytic converters are positioned much closer to the combustion chambers, enabling extremely rapid converter \"light-off\" after engine start. A significant weight savings is realized by eliminating traditional exhaust manifolds. Downstream of the close-coupled catalytic converters, a hydroformed 2-into-1 collector pipe carries exhaust gases to a secondary, underfloor catalytic converter.<br> <br> <strong>Emissions Control</strong><br> <br> The 2014 MDX 3.5-liter V-6 engine meets the tough EPA Tier 2/Bin 5 and CARB LEV II ULEV emissions standards, and is certified to this level of emissions performance for 120,000 miles. A number of advanced technologies are factors in the emissions performance. The unique cylinder head-mounted close-coupled catalytic converters light off more quickly after engine start up, and a 32-bit RISC microprocessor within the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) boosts computing power to improve the precision of spark and fuel delivery.<br> <br> The MDX\'s V-6 engine features Programmed Fuel Injection (PGM-FI) that continually adjusts the fuel delivery to yield the best combination of power, low fuel consumption and low emissions. Multiple sensors constantly monitor critical engine operating parameters such as intake air temperature, ambient air pressure, throttle position, intake airflow volume, intake manifold pressure, coolant temperature, exhaust-to-air ratios, as well as the position of the crankshaft and the camshafts.<br> <br> To further improve emissions compliance, the 3.5-liter V-6 makes use of an after-cat exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system that allows cleaner, cooler EGR gas to be fed back into the intake system. An EGR system, especially one that delivers a cleaner, cooler charge, reduces pumping loss for better fuel efficiency.<br> <br> <strong>One-Touch Start System</strong><br> <br> To ensure consistent starting, the MDX has a one-touch start system that maintains starter engagement until the engine starts. Should the driver release the Start button before the engine starts, the system will start the vehicle. Simply push the Start button (with a foot on the brake pedal and the fob in the vehicle) and the engine will automatically start up.<br> <br> <strong>Noise &amp; Vibration Control</strong><br> <br> With its 60-degree V-angle and compact, rigid and lightweight die-cast aluminum cylinder block assembly, the 3.5-liter V-6 powerplant is exceptionally smooth during operation. Other factors that help reduce engine noise and vibration are a rigid forged-steel crankshaft, die-cast accessory mounts, and a stiff cast-aluminum oil pan that reduces cylinder block flex.<br> <br> 100,000+/- Mile Tune-up Intervals<br> <br> The MDX\'s 3.5-liter V-6 requires no scheduled maintenance for 100,000+/- miles or more, other than periodic inspections and normal fluid and filter replacements. The first tune-up includes water pump inspection, valve adjustment, replacement of the camshaft timing belt, and the installation of new spark plugs.<br> <br> <strong>Maintenance Minder™ System</strong><br> <br> To eliminate unnecessary service stops while ensuring that the vehicle is properly maintained, the MDX has a Maintenance Minder™ system that continually monitors the vehicle\'s operating condition. When maintenance is required, the driver is alerted via a message on the Multi-Information Display (MID).<br> <br> The Maintenance Minder™ system monitors operating conditions such as oil and coolant temperature along with engine speed to determine the proper service intervals. Depending on operating conditions, oil change intervals can be extended to a maximum of 10,000 miles, potentially sparing the owner considerable expense and inconvenience over the life of the vehicle. The owner-resettable system monitors all normal service parts and systems, including oil and filter, tire rotation, air-cleaner, automatic transmission fluid, spark plugs, timing belt, coolant, brake pads and more. To mitigate driver distraction, maintenance alerts are presented on the MID only when the ignition is first turned on, not while driving.<br> <br> <strong>Sequential SportShift 6-Speed Automatic Transmission</strong><br> <br> The 2014 MDX is equipped with a 6-speed automatic transmission featuring Sequential SportShift with steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters and two automatic shift modes. The Sequential SportShift 6-speed automatic offers excellent launch-feel, acceleration performance and fuel efficiency. Gearing is unchanged from the 2013 model.<br> <br> The straight-gate shifter is an intuitive and easy-to-use design that takes up little space in the center console. The shifter allows the driver to choose P (Park), R (Reverse), N (Neutral), D (Drive) and S (Sport mode) for more performance-oriented shift programming.<br> <br> Both shift performance and smoothness are improved by cooperative control between the Drive-by-Wire throttle system and the electronically-controlled, Sequential SportShift 6-speed automatic transmission. The engine is throttled by the engine management system during upshifts and downshifts; thus the function of the engine and transmission can be closely choreographed for faster, smoother shifting. As a result, the peak g-forces (or \"shift shock\") are reduced significantly during upshifts and downshifts.<br> <br> The 6-speed transmission can be controlled by a straight-gate console-mounted shifter or a steering wheel-mounted paddle shifter system that works whenever the transmission is in either of its two automatic modes.<br> <br> In addition to Grade Logic Control, Shift Hold control and Cornering G Shift control, common with the outgoing model, the 2014 MDX adds a Sport mode for increased driver involvement. All of the transmission logic systems work together to automatically alter shift timing based on driving conditions.<br> <br> <strong>Automatic Modes</strong><br> <br> The Sequential SportShift 6-speed transmission can be operated in two different, fully automatic modes with the console-mounted straight-gate shifter. The D (or \"Drive\") mode is ideal for most driving situations, and combines fuel efficiency with smooth operation and responsive power when needed. The Sport mode is for more performance-oriented driving, and features more aggressive shift mapping to keep engine rpm higher for greater acceleration and response.<br> <br> When in the D mode (optimized for normal driving), the transmission incorporates an advanced Grade Logic Control System, Shift Hold Control and Cornering G Shift Control - all of which reduce unwanted shifting and gear hunting. The result is smart transmission operation that optimizes fuel efficiency and keeps the transmission in the appropriate gear for driving conditions, generating excellent performance and smooth operation.<br> <br> While ascending or descending hills, Grade Logic Control alters the transmission\'s shift schedule to reduce shift frequency and improve speed control. The transmission ECU continually measures throttle position, vehicle speed and acceleration/deceleration to determine when the vehicle is on a hill. The shift schedule is then adjusted - during ascents to hold the transmission in lower gears to boost climbing power, and during descents to provide greater engine braking.<br> <br> Shift Hold Control keeps the transmission in its current (lower) gear ratio during aggressive driving, as in the case of decelerating at a corner entry. Shift Hold Control leaves the chassis undisturbed by eliminating excess shifting and ensures that power will be immediately available (without a downshift) at the corner exit. Cornering G Shift Control monitors the speed of each rear wheel independently to determine when the Acura MDX is turning. When the system detects a sufficient speed differential between the rear wheels, it will suppress any unwanted upshifts. This prevents the transmission from upshifting during a corner, which could upset the chassis balance thus requiring downshifting again at the corner exit when the throttle is applied.<br> <br> <strong>Temporary Manual Operation in \"Drive\"</strong><br> <br> While in Drive mode, special transmission logic programming allows the use of the steering-wheel-mounted paddle shifters. When the driver operates the paddle shifters, the transmission responds to the driver\'s shift command and then returns to its normal fully automatic mode if further paddle shift inputs are not made within a given time. This special logic makes it easy for the driver to command a quick downshift without leaving the comfort of Drive mode.<br> <br> <strong>Manual Mode</strong><br> <br> By moving the center console shift lever fully aft into the \"S\" position, Sport mode is engaged. This mode offers automatic operation with more aggressive shift mapping. A pull on the racing-inspired paddle shifters (mounted on the steering wheel) places the transmission in fully manual mode until another mode of operation is selected with the console-mounted shifter (e.g., switched to Drive mode). A digital display in the instrument cluster indicates which gear the transmission is in.<br> <br> A double-kick-down feature lets the driver command a sport-minded double downshift - such as from Fifth to Third gear. By pulling on the left downshift paddle twice in rapid succession, the transmission will drop directly to the chosen lower gear ratio. The Drive-by-Wire throttle system also creates a \"blip\" of the throttle to help match gear speeds while downshifting.<br> <br> To prevent harm to the powertrain when the transmission is paddle shifted by the driver (including during double-kick-down shifts), the system will inhibit potentially damaging shifts. As an added safety measure, the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) can also cut off fuel to the engine to prevent over-revving. If fuel cut-off is insufficient to prevent engine over-revving, as may be possible when the vehicle is on a steep downhill, the transmission will automatically upshift to prevent damage. On downshifts, the transmission will not execute a driver command that will over-rev the engine.<br> <br> For improved stop-and-go performance and to help prevent \"lugging\" the engine, the Sequential SportShift transmission will automatically downshift to First gear even though the transmission has been left in a higher gear, (except in Second gear) as the vehicle comes to a stop. In Manual Mode, when coming to a stop in Second gear, the vehicle will start in Second gear as well.<br> <br> The Sequential SportShift 6-speed automatic transmission is teamed with a special torque converter that has a high maximum torque rating and a high capacity lock-up clutch. The lock-up assembly uses multiple lock-up disks to reduce heat build-up during operation and for lock-up activation over a wide range of driving conditions that helps improve fuel efficiency.<br> <br> <strong>Front Wheel Drive</strong><br> <br> For the first time ever, the MDX now offers standard front wheel drive. With its efficient design and lighter weight, the MDX front wheel drive system makes a significant contribution to overall fuel efficiency. With EPA fuel economy ratings of 20/28/23 (city/highway/combined), the front-wheel drive MDX has a 2 mpg ratings advantage over its SH-AWD counterpart in the city, a 1 mpg advantage in the highway, and 2 mpg advantage in combined ratings.<br> <br> <strong>Super-Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®)</strong><br> <br> The MDX is available with Acura\'s acclaimed Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®), which progressively distributes optimum torque not only between the front and rear axles, but also between the left and right rear wheels. The system is complemented by Agile Handling Assist which employs the anti-lock brake system to individually brake either the left or right front wheel to reduce yaw delay (the period between the steering wheel input and the rotation of the body) to improve corner traceability and balance.<br> <br> The benefits of the SH-AWD® system are superior all-weather handling and neutral, accurate steering under power that is unmatched by front-drive, rear-drive or conventional all-wheel-drive systems.<br> <br> By rotating the outside rear wheel faster than the front axle while cornering, SH-AWD® uses torque vectoring to create a yaw moment to help turn the vehicle through the corner - reducing understeer and improving controllability. With cornering forces more evenly distributed between front and rear tires, overall cornering power is increased - on wet or dry roads.<br> <br> Vehicles with high power ratings using conventional front or rear drive systems often employ a limited-slip differential to help maintain traction when under power. By linking inside and outside drive wheels, these systems tend to resist turning and can increase understeer. Conventional AWD systems similarly work to link the inboard and outboard tires as well as the front and rear axles-which can create resistance to turning. Using torque vectoring to help turn the vehicle, SH-AWD® delivers more responsive, neutral and predictable handling performance, while providing outstanding all-weather traction and control.<br> <br> <strong>Electronic Controls and Parameters</strong><br> <br> The SH-AWD® system works in cooperation with the MDX\'s Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) system and Agile Handling Assist to optimize torque distribution for superior handling and traction utilization. The Electronic Control Unit (ECU) provides information on engine rpm, airflow and transmission gear-ratio selection, while the VSA® ECU provides wheel-speed data. The SH-AWD® ECU also monitors steering angle, lateral G-forces, vehicle yaw rate and electromagnetic clutch engagement for the right and left rear axle shafts. Drive torque is calculated from ECU information, and then the acceleration situation, wheel spin, lateral G-force and steering angle are used to determine the front-to-rear torque distribution and the torque split between right and left rear wheels.<br> <br> <strong>SH-AWD® System Layout</strong><br> <br> The MDX SH-AWD® is a full-time all-wheel-drive system that requires no driver interaction or monitoring, thanks to a torque-transfer unit that is bolted directly to the front-mounted transaxle. The torque-transfer unit receives torque from a helical gear that is attached to the front differential\'s ring gear, and a short horizontal shaft and hypoid gear set within the torque-transfer unit\'s case send power to the rear propeller shaft, which in turn transfers power to the rear drive unit.<br> <br> The MDX SH-AWD® rear drive unit is constantly overdriven by 1.7-percent and the resulting overdrive effect is regulated by left- and right-side electromagnetic clutch packs (located in the rear differential) that independently control the power delivered to each rear wheel.<br> <br> Direct electromagnetic clutch systems mounted on either side of the hypoid gear that drives the rear axles control the amount of torque sent to each rear wheel and provide a limited-slip differential function when needed. The clutches can be controlled as a pair to alter front/rear torque split or they can be controlled independently to allow 100-percent of available rear axle torque to go to just one rear wheel.<br> <br> An electromagnetic coil modulates the pressure controlling each clutch pack, which changes the speed of the sun gear within the rear differential\'s planetary gear set to control the amount of torque sent to each wheel. Electromagnetic control of the clutches permits the torque delivery to each rear wheel to be proportioned in an exceptionally quick and precise manner, which reduces wheel-slip in low-traction conditions.<br> <br> The clutch packs and their friction material are carefully designed to withstand the small amount of continuous slip between front and rear axles created by the 1.7-percent speed differential - all while delivering the durability expected of an Acura product. Through an oil-temperature sensor, the SH-AWD® Control Unit monitors the rear differential\'s clutch-plate coefficient of friction (which changes with temperature) in each clutch pack and then adjusts the voltage to each electromagnetic coil to compensate. As total vehicle miles accumulate, the SH-AWD® Control Unit uses data from a feedback loop to adjust the voltage supplied to the electromagnetic coils to compensate for any clutch wear, ensuring optimal and consistent transmission of torque.<br> <br> <strong>Trailer Hitch and Trailer Hitch ATF Cooler Kit (Optional)</strong><br> <br> When the need to tow arises, put your MDX to work by adding the Trailer Hitch. A receiver-style hitch accommodates a variety of trailer coupler designs, and includes a draw bar, retaining pin, clip, and wiring harness with 7-pin round-style connector. A 1-7/8 -inch or 2-inch balls available separately. The optional Trailer Hitch ATF Cooler Kit will allow towing of up to 5,000 lbs.<br> <br> <strong>Remote Engine Start with Vehicle Feedback</strong><br> <br> The MDX with Advance and Entertainment Packages provides the ability to start the vehicle\'s engine remotely. This enables drivers to start their MDX, thereby activating the climate control system before they get to the vehicle - perfect for hot or cold days. The remote is designed to have a range of operation of at least 300 feet. To start the engine remotely, the owner presses the LOCK button and then holds the ENGINE button for a few seconds. When the engine is started remotely, the wipers, lighting and audio systems remain off, and the security system remains set. The engine will run for up to 10 minutes after remote starting, and then shut off automatically if the owner doesn\'t reach the vehicle within that time. When the owner does get to the MDX within 10 minutes, the engine will keep running while the owner unlocks the vehicle and gets in.<br> <br> This system also provides feedback to the owner to confirm whether the engine is running or the vehicle is locked. The remote has three LED indicators: amber, green and red. To confirm engine start, the owner presses the LOCK button and then holds the ENGINE button for a few seconds. The amber indicator will flash while the remote communicates with the vehicle. If the engine is running, the green LED will then light for one second. If the engine is not running, the red indicator will light for one second. To verify whether the vehicle is locked, the owner presses the LOCK button once. After the amber light comes on, either the green or red LED will light for one second to indicate that the vehicle is locked or not, respectively. And if the red LED flashes three times, the vehicle is out of the remote\'s range.<br> <br> This system can provide owners with the comfort of a pre-warmed vehicle on a cold winter morning - or a pre-cooled interior on hot days. Plus, it adds the convenience and confidence of knowing that their vehicle is securely locked, even far beyond the range of a typical remote.<br> <br> <strong>STYLING</strong><br> <br> The 2014 MDX design, created in the Acura Design Studio in Torrance, California, was developed under the theme of \"Aero Sculpture.\" With its alluring proportions, smooth, arching bodylines and confident stance, the 2014 MDX communicates a look of sophistication and elegance while delivering new levels of aerodynamic efficiency. Its five-point grille features a chrome surround and a decisive satin sash with black grille bars. The new MDX is the second new Acura vehicle to feature Acura\'s signature Jewel Eye™ LED headlights, with five LED elements per side, providing a unique and sophisticated appearance day and night. The side mirror-mounted turn signals, taillights, CHMSL and license-plate lights are also LED, with a look that is uniquely MDX.<br> <br> The MDX body sides are defined by a tall and dramatic beltline, windswept roofline, decisive upper and lower character lines, stylized chrome door handles integrated into the upper character line, dynamic fender arches, and chrome window surrounds. The Advance and Entertainment Packages also has elegantly functional chrome roof rails, and all models include a functional rear spoiler.<br> <br> <strong>BODY</strong><br> <br> 2.0 inches longer, 1.5 inches lower, and 1.3 inches narrower than the model it replaces, the Acura MDX is designed to cheat the wind with 2-percent less frontal area and a 16-percent lower coefficient of drag. This makes the third-generation MDX the most efficient vehicle in its luxury class, garnering higher fuel economy ratings than the previous-generation model in every EPA rating category including City, Highway and Combined. In addition to the 16-percent improvement in aerodynamic drag, the new MDX is more luxurious in appearance.<br> <br> The MDX body is highly rigid with torsional rigidity improved by 12 percent. In addition, the 2014 MDX boasts a 67 percent increase in rigidity at critical suspension mounting points, which combined with overall body rigidity gains provides the foundation for its confident handling capabilities, refined ride quality and reduced cabin noise and vibration.<br> <br> The MDX incorporates Acura\'s next-generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) front frame structure for enhanced frontal collision protection. Collision protection is further enhanced by the world\'s first ultra-high strength steel, one-piece stiffener ring - comprising the A-pillar and B-pillar, roof rail and lower frame member - for improved management of collision energy in frontal offset and side impacts and roof load management in the event of a rollover.<br> <br> <strong>LED Lighting</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s new Jewel Eye™ light-emitting diode (LED) headlight arrays provide brighter and sharper nighttime illumination and visibility compared to contemporary high-intensity discharge (HID) headlights - and far superior performance compared to traditional halogen projector beams. Besides improving driver confidence and passive safety, the LED headlights also use less energy, helping to enhance fuel efficiency by reducing engine loads. In addition, the LED headlights last up to three times longer than HID headlights and up to six times longer than halogen headlights - contributing to less frequent replacement and the associated cost savings.<br> <br> The unique styling of the LED array helps give the MDX a distinctive appearance, both day and night. The array includes five individual LEDs per side, covered by a composite lens and accented by a chrome trim surround. All 5 LEDs illuminate as DRLs. The three outer also function as the low-beams, while the inside two LEDs serve as high-beams. An auto on-off function is included, and the low-beams are also keyed to the remote key fob operation.<br> <br> The MDX also features LED taillights, license-plate illumination and side view mirror-mounted puddle lights (and for overhead and accent lighting in the MDX cabin). LED fog lights are optional on the MDX.<br> <br> <strong>Acoustic Glass</strong><br> <br> The MDX utilizes 4.5-mm thick, 3-layer acoustic windshield and 4.8 mm front door glass mitigates wind, road and traffic noise in the cabin. The rear side windows are also thicker than in the previous MDX - up from 3.5 mm to 5.0 mm.<br> <br> <strong>Underbody Airflow</strong><br> <br> Carefully managing underbody airflow helps reduce turbulence and drag for improved fuel efficiency, while also enhancing stability at highway speeds. Strategically placed aerodynamic under-body components - including front splash shields, an engine exit cover, and a mid-floor undercover - help smooth airflow between the body and road surface, while also helping to minimize power-robbing turbulence and drag. A front air dam with a broad wickerbill, along with strakes positioned ahead of the rear tires, further improves efficient airflow. The result is increased fuel efficiency, increased stability and reduced wind noise on the highway.<br> <br> <strong>Advanced Materials, Lower Weight</strong><br> <br> With high-strength steel, aluminum and magnesium totaling 64-percent of its body structure, at a curb weight of 4,297 pounds the 2014 MDX is 275 pounds lighter than the previous model. It is also has the lightest published weight in its segment, which directly contributes to improved acceleration, light and nimble handling, and class-leading fuel economy ratings.<br> <br> The MDX is assembled from steel stampings that are robotically welded together to form a single, lightweight unit-body with a high level of rigidity. A variety of advanced materials and techniques give this structure exceptional strength and uniformity. One is high-strength steel, which composes 59 percent of the body structure by weight, including the use of 1,500-megapascal ultra-high strength \"hot-stamped\" steel in 7 percent of the body, enhancing collision protection while minimizing vehicle weight.<br> <br> An example of high-strength components in the MDX are the one-piece stiffener rings around the front doors, a world\'s first technology. Formed from a single piece of hot-stamped steel, each ring provides immense strength for enhanced performance in frontal offset (small overlap) and side impacts, as well as enhanced roof crush protection. Likewise, the rigid tailgate opening is engineered to distribute loads through the rear suspension mounts, further aiding body stiffness.<br> <br> The MDX steering hanger beam is made of a magnesium casting, which spans the entire width of the interior (behind the instrument panel). This new three-piece component replaces the 26-piece aluminum version used in the previous MDX and saves 7.5 pounds while reducing the potential for intrusion of the steering column into the cabin in a frontal collision.<br> <br> Light weight is of particular interest to driving enthusiasts. Performance can be increased by reducing weight, as is continually proven on the racetrack (including the Nürburgring Nordschleife road course in Germany, where the 2014 MDX was tested and validated). Racing experience and supercomputers were both used to reduce weight in the new MDX unit-body without sacrificing strength. This enhances its power-to-weight ratio, as well as handling abilities and braking performance.<br> <br> <strong>Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH) Reduction</strong><br> <br> To create a premium driving experience, extensive research and countermeasures were applied to help reduce noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) throughout the new MDX. Acura engineers began by working to eliminate NVH at its source with technologies such as a highly rigid unit-body, tightly controlled manufacturing tolerances, a highly rigid aluminum-alloy engine block and forged-steel crankshaft, electronically calibrated engine mounts, careful aerodynamic tailoring, acoustic glass, and more.<br> <br> <strong>Active Control Engine Mounts</strong><br> <br> Debuting on the 2014 MDX is an Active Control Engine Mount system (ACM) that minimizes the effects of engine vibration as the Variable Cylinder Management (VCM) system switches between 3- and 6-cylinder modes. Special vibration sensors alert the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) to direct ACM actuators - which are positioned at the front and rear of the engine - to cancel vibration. Additionally, an Active Sound Control system, operating through the vehicle\'s stereo speakers, further reduces low-frequencies associated with 3-cylinder operation by producing a reverse-phase sound profile.<br> <br> <strong>Road Noise Reduction</strong><br> <br> To help isolate road noise and reduce its intrusion into the cabin, the lower suspension components attach to fully isolated steel subframes that ride on specially tuned bushings. In addition, improved door sealing and melt sheet, an asphalt-based sound-damping material, is bonded to the floor and wheel arches of all Acura vehicles at the time of assembly.<br> <br> <strong>Wind Noise Reduction</strong><br> <br> Smoothing airflow over the complex shape of a vehicle body can help reduce not only aerodynamic drag, but also the wind noise that is transmitted to the cabin. The 2014 MDX was texted extensively in a full-sized wind tunnel. Together with computer simulations, wind-tunnel testing combined with sophisticated computer modeling allows engineers to identify areas of the body that are prone to wind noise - and then analyze fine detail changes with a high degree of accuracy.<br> <br> One result of this testing is the MDX\'s body-panel fit, which helps minimize gaps that create turbulence and wind noise when the vehicle is traveling at speed. Other details include carefully styled A-pillars and side mirrors, a flush-fitting windshield, moonroof and side glass, and numerous other design details that all contribute to the low wind-noise characteristics of the 2014 MDX.<br> <br> Wind-noise attenuation details also include components that are not visible. For instance, the MDX\'s body sections are isolated using 22 clip-in foam inserts that expand during the baking cycles of the body painting process. This material reduces wind noise transmitted into the vehicle. The fin-type 2.7-inch high antenna used for XM® Radio, AcuraLink and engine remote start, is positioned at the rear of the roof panel and is designed for low wind noise at speed. The AM/FM radio antenna is laminated into the right rear side window.<br> <br> <strong>Outside Mirrors with Reverse Gear Tilt-Down</strong><br> <br> To improve convenience while parallel parking, the MDX\'s aerodynamically sculpted outside mirrors have a reverse-gear tilt-down feature that allows the driver to see the curb or curbside objects. Either the left- or right-hand mirror can be selected to automatically tilt down when reversing. After shifting into reverse, the driver simply moves the mirror-adjustment selector switch position to either the right or left. The corresponding mirror then tilts down to provide a clear view of the curb or curbside on that side of the vehicle. The mirror automatically returns to its previous position when the gear-selector lever is moved out of Reverse.<br> <br> <strong>Auto-Dimming Side Mirrors (Advance and Entertainment Packages)</strong><br> <br> Included in the Advance and Entertainment Packages, auto-dimming side mirrors use the same activation sensor as the MDX\'s auto-dimming inside rearview mirror. The auto-dimming function of all three mirrors helps reduce glare during nighttime driving, especially from the headlights of following vehicles.<br> <br> Included in the Technology Package and up, LED puddle lights, mounted on the bottom of the sideview mirror housings, add convenience for the driver and front passenger at night. These LEDs automatically illuminate when the driver approaches and the vehicle detects the remote.<br> <br> <strong>Expanded View Driver\'s Mirror</strong><br> <br> A new Expanded View Driver\'s Mirror performs like two mirrors in one. The larger, inset portion of the mirror is relatively flat and works like a conventional sideview mirror to show objects to the side of the vehicle. The outer portion of the mirror is optically convex and functions as a wide-angle mirror to expand the driver\'s view to the side by approximately 43-percent, helping to reduce the blind-zone area.<br> <br> <strong>Rain-Sensing Wipers (Technology and up)</strong><br> <br> MDX models with the Technology Package include rain-sensing wipers that automatically activate if water is detected on the windshield. Designed to cover the maximum possible windshield area, the left (driver) and right (front passenger) windshield wipers are 26 and 20 inches long, respectively. The rear wiper is 14 inches long.<br> <br> <strong>One-Touch Turn Signals</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s one-touch turn signals improve convenience for the driver when making routine lane changes. With this system, a quick movement of the turn-signal lever (between 0.4 sec. and 1 sec.) provides three blinks of the turn signals - an ideal strategy for changing lanes. Holding the lever for one second or longer (past the \"click point\") provides continuous blinking, such as for signaling a turn or exiting a thoroughfare.<br> <br> <strong>Parking Sensors (Advance and Entertainment Packages)</strong><br> <br> The Advance and Entertainement Packages includes parking sensors (4 front and 4 rear), located on the front and rear bumpers. The sensors use ultrasonic wave technology to detect nearby obstacles. If an object is detected, the system will sound an audible alert and can display a warning icon in the Multi-Information Display (MID) and upper display.<br> <br> Alert sound characteristics change depending on how close the Acura MDX is to the object. The system starts with slow intermittent beeps when an object is first detected, and progresses to quick intermittent beeps as the MDX moves closer. The system will sound a continuous beep when the vehicle is within a few inches of the object.<br> <br> Note that the parking sensors cannot detect all obstacles, and that the driver is always responsible for making sure the path is clear when operating the vehicle.<br> <br> <strong>Blind Spot Information (BSI)</strong><br> <br> Included in the Technology Package and up, the Blind Spot Information (BSI) system uses radar sensors located on both sides of the rear bumpers to continually monitor blind-spot areas to help determine whether a vehicle is in the driver\'s blind spot.<br> <br> The system provides a visual cue by lighting or flashing an indicator near the sideview mirrors, depending on which side of the MDX a vehicle is detected. The system also gives an audible warning to further alert the driver if the turn signal is activated on the side where a vehicle is being detected. To prevent false alarms while maneuvering at low speed, the BSI system is disabled below approximately 20 mph.<br> <br> Note that BSI cannot detect all vehicles, and that some vehicles or devices may interfere with the system. Drivers should always visually check for the presence of other vehicles before changing lanes.<br> <br> <strong>Multi-Angle Rearview Camera</strong><br> <br> All 2014 MDX models feature a multi-view rear camera with a large console display. Its wide-view format significantly expands the driver\'s rearward visibility when the camera is in use, increasing convenience and peace of mind.<br> <br> <strong>Low-Profile Roof Rails (Advance and Entertainment Packages)</strong><br> <br> Included with the Advance Package, aerodynamically shaped roof rails add versatility without detracting from the MDX\'s streamlined package. Chrome-plated for an upscale appearance, the rails accept available cross bars that can hold a variety of accessories including a storage case or racks for bikes, boards or skis.<br> <br> <strong>Smart Entry with Push Button Start</strong><br> <br> The MDX features Acura\'s Smart Entry with Push Button Start. The Smart Entry system permits access to the vehicle\'s front doors without having to operate the key fob or a conventional key (all four doors are accessible with the Technology Package and up). The Smart Entry remote has a unique digital identity and the MDX can be unlocked when the driver grabs one of the door handles while the remote is in his/her possession. When carrying the fob (or if all doors are unlocked), the tailgate can be opened using the handle located on the MDX\'s rear tailgate.<br> <br> Once the driver has opened the door and is seated, the Smart Entry system allows the MDX to be started by pushing the Engine Start/Stop button positioned on the instrument panel (so long as the driver\'s foot is on the brake); to turn off the MDX, the driver simply pushes the button again with the vehicle in Park. When leaving the vehicle, a press of the soft-touch button on the exterior front door handles or tailgate locks all the doors. Alternatively, pressing the Lock button on the Smart Entry remote will also simultaneously lock all doors.<br> <br> Smart Entry also features a unique \"quick vent\" feature. When the operator depressed the \"unlock\" button on the keyless remote for two seconds after unlocking the doors, the system lowers all four side windows and opens the power moonroof to quickly vent interior heat. In addition, by inserting the built-in key into the driver\'s door lock and holding the key in the \"lock\" position, all open windows can be simultaneously raised.<br> <br> <strong>Remote Preferences</strong><br> <br> The Acura MDX comes with two keyless remotes that can be set with a unique preference to accommodate the preferences of two different drivers. The available preferences include driver seat, steering wheel and mirror positions, along with select HVAC functions. Other preferences include turning entry lights on or off, audio system pre-sets, air conditioning preferences, and navigation system settings. In the event both owners use the car at the same time, the MDX will recognize the keyless remote that approaches the vehicle first.<br> <br> <strong>Tailgate Functions</strong><br> <br> Like previous MDX models, the new 2014 MDX\'s rear tailgate can be controlled from the remote key fob-including unlocking, opening and closing the tailgate. In addition, the rear tailgate is now part of the Smart Entry system. When the MDX is locked, and the driver approaches the rear tailgate, the tailgate will automatically unlock (as long as the fob comes within about 32 inches of the vehicle). The tailgate can then be opened simply by lightly touching the switch membrane beneath the Acura badge.<br> <br> <strong>Exterior Colors</strong><br> <br> The 2014 MDX is available in seven exterior colors, including three metallic and four pearl colors. All colors are expressive and luxurious in appearance, complimenting the MDX\'s sophisticated and dynamic body shape. The acid-resistant epoxy clear-coat paint is superior to typical clear-coat paints for increased resistance to urban pollutants.<br> <br> Silver Moon Metallic<br> Crystal Black Pearl<br> Dark Cherry Pearl<br> Forest Mist Metallic<br> Graphite Luster Metallic<br> Fathom Blue Pearl<br> White Diamond Pearl<br> <br> <strong>CHASSIS</strong><br> <br> The all-new chassis of the 2014 MDX has a tremendous operational bandwidth. Among its defining characteristics, the MDX is easy to drive while fostering a high degree of driver confidence in wide range of weather and road conditions. It is also more luxurious, with improved suspension isolation that reduces road noise, vibration and harshness in the cabin.<br> <br> The 2014 MDX chassis features new front and rear suspension systems. In all trim levels, the new MDX imparts more confidence for the driver with electric power steering (EPS) that improves low-speed steering effort and high-speed steering feel. It is also secure with standard Agile Handling Assist and Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®), and available Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS) and Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS). The chassis also contributes to fuel efficiency, with low rolling-resistance tires and low-drag bearings and brake calipers.<br> <br> All of the features above make the MDX well suited to its role as a luxury transportation solution for those who want to travel in comfort, safety and style.<br> <br> <strong>4-Wheel Independent Suspension</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s independent front and rear suspension systems are engineered to provide long wheel travel and excellent compliance for a luxurious ride, together with the precise damping and spring rates needed for excellent handling and a sporty driving feel.<br> <br> In front is an all-new strut-type system with forged-aluminum lower control arms with hydraulic bushings, coil springs and a solid stabilizer bar. This setup uses moderate spring rates, relatively firm damping and specially tuned bushings for a smooth, controlled ride with exceptional cornering abilities. The upper front damper mounts provide a \"triple path\" load-bearing system that absorbs road vibration and harshness.<br> <br> At the rear is an all-new compact multi-link design with a tubular stabilizer bar. This multi-link system allows a generous amount of wheel travel and excellent compliance for a supple ride, together with confident cornering and handling. All rear suspension control arms are steel - including high-strength steel upper and lower control arms. Geometry for the system is improved, with the upper damper mounts located on the body side rails for greater rigidity, and softer bushings calibrated to reduce road noise without compromising handling.<br> <br> Suspension load paths are reduced from ten to just six, and where the previous setup transmitted suspension loads to the vehicles rear wheelhouse, the new setup transmits suspension loads to the more rigid body side frame, which allows for more aggressive tuning of suspension bushings to aid both ride comfort and handling precision. The transmission of road vibration to the second- and third-row seats is significantly reduced. Further, the elimination of the forward trailing arm on the previous MDX\'s rear suspension allows for a 1.8-inch lower floor, providing for easier third-row ingress and egress (along with 4.5-inch wider foot entry point enabled by the longer wheelbase and redesigned second-row seat).<br> <br> <strong>Vibration-Damping Subframes</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s engine, transmission and suspension components are mounted on rigid steel subframes. These subframes attach to the unit body at rubber-isolated mounting points that help keep powertrain and road noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) out of the passenger cabin. The subframe rear mounts are filled with specially tuned hydraulic fluid for maximum effectiveness. Permanently sealed, they require no scheduled maintenance. The rear subframe is particularly sophisticated, with hydroformed side elements for maximum strength and minimal weight.<br> <br> <strong>Amplitude Reactive Dampers</strong><br> <br> Amplitude Reactive Dampers provide superior ride comfort and handling in all driving conditions. The dampers have two separate hydraulic circuits - one tuned to optimize the ride quality on smooth roads with relatively small irregularities, and the other tuned to handle large inputs resulting from rough roads or large steering and braking inputs. As a result, the MDX remains smooth and supple when cruising, and secure and tight feeling in corners with reduced body roll.<br> <br> The key Amplitude Reactive Damper technology consists of two separate damping pistons: a main piston and a second piston. To improve overall ride comfort, when smaller inputs occur during normal driving conditions, only the main piston works to provide the ideal damping characteristics. To improve the MDX\'s ride and handling on rougher surfaces and during more aggressive driving, the second piston operates to provide additional damping force.<br> <br> The Amplitude Reactive Dampers are a purely mechanical system that does not require electronic controls. Altogether, they provide a much wider range of effective damping performance than offered by the previous base MDX.<br> <br> <strong>Electric Power Steering (EPS)</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s new Motion-Adaptive Electric Power Steering (EPS) system helps enhance fuel efficiency by putting less demand on the engine, compared to the previous engine-driven hydraulic-boost system. At low speeds, EPS lowers steering effort, improving driver comfort and convenience in city driving and while maneuvering. The system also provides a precision road feel while cornering, along with a firmer and sportier feel on the highway. Compared to the previous MDX steering system, new EPS has a 9-percent quicker ratio for quicker overall steering response that is more sedan-like than in the previous-generation MDX.<br> <br> The Acura MDX\'s standard Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) will adjust steering effort depending on the selected mode - Normal, Comfort or Sport. In Normal mode, the steering effort is balanced between comfortable and sporty. Selecting the Comfort mode eases steering effort for a more relaxed driving experience, especially at low speeds. The Sport mode provides a firmer steering feel with higher effort that complements more aggressive driving.<br> <br> Debuted on the 2013 RDX, Motion-Adaptive EPS works with Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA®) and Electric Power Steering to detect instability in low traction conditions (both during cornering and under braking) and automatically initiates steering inputs aimed at prompting the driver to steer in the correct direction. This technology supports the driver\'s action in operating the vehicle more safely and comfortably.<br> <br> The Motion-Adaptive EPS system consists of a rack-and-pinion steering gear with an electric motor is located next to pinion axle. To control the level of assist the Powertrain Control Module receives signals from a speed sensor and, coupled with a steering sensor for torque and rotation, then calculates the optimal amount of assist and sends a signal to the electric motor.<br> <br> When compared to the operation of a conventional hydraulic pump power steering system, Motion-Adaptive EPS increases efficiency because it does not draw a continuous amount of power directly from the engine. Other advantages of electric power-assisted steering include its simplicity, its lower power consumption (which helps improve fuel efficiency), and its compactness (and resulting lower overall weight).<br> <br> <strong>Agile Handling Assist</strong><br> <br> Standard on the MDX, the Agile Handling Assist system selectively uses the vehicle\'s brakes to improve initial turning response and overall cornering ability. Agile Handling Assist utilizes brake vectoring to improve corner traceability and confident handling feel. By applying braking force to the inside wheels at the entry to a corner, the system creates a yaw moment, thus generating more turning force.<br> <br> <strong>4-Wheel Disc Brakes with ABS and Brake Assist</strong><br> <br> The 2014 MDX has 4-wheel disc brakes with a 4-channel anti-lock braking system (ABS) for a powerful and linear brake feel, and confident stops in a wide range of driving conditions. The ventilated front discs are 12.6 inches in diameter and use two-piston calipers, while the solid rear discs are 13.0 inches in diameter and have single-piston calipers. The calipers are designed to reduce brake drag when not in use, reducing rolling resistance and improving fuel efficiency in the process.<br> <br> An Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) independently modulates braking power at each wheel to help the driver retain steering control during heavy braking, while Brake Assist recognizes emergency braking situations and almost instantly applies full braking force when appropriate.<br> <br> <strong>Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®)</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s standard Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA) system works in conjunction with the Drive-by-Wire throttle, ABS, EPS and SH-AWD® (if so equipped) to enhance vehicle stability when cornering. If understeer or oversteer is detected, VSA selectively reduces power and/or applies braking force to individual wheels to help correct the condition and stabilize the vehicle. VSA helps improve all aspects of performance (including turning, braking and straight-line stability) in low-grip situations, thus helping to keep the vehicle on its intended course. The system is calibrated to add stability and predictability transparently, and drivers may not even notice when VSA is working.<br> <br> As an integral component of VSA, traction control monitors drive-wheel slippage, such as when starting or driving on slick surfaces. If this is detected, traction control activates one or more brake calipers and reduces engine torque to slow the spinning wheel so it can regain traction.<br> <br> <strong>Trailer Stability Assist</strong><br> <br> Standard on SH-AWD MDX models, Trailer Stability Assist helps enhance vehicle stability while a trailer is being towed. An integral part of Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®), Trailer Stability Assist detects trailer oscillations that can result from improper loading, excessive speed, adverse road conditions, crosswinds or emergency-avoidance maneuvers.<br> <br> When such oscillations are detected, Trailer Stability Assist provides a warning and gives the driver the opportunity to reduce speed. If the driver does not reduce speed - or does not reduce speed sufficiently to stabilize the vehicle - then VSA automatically activates to help damp the oscillations before they can increase and further upset the stability of the vehicle and trailer.<br> <br> <strong>Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS)</strong><br> <br> The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) alerts the driver via a lighted icon on the instrument panel whenever any of the vehicle\'s tires has a significantly low pressure. Should this occur, TPMS automatically activates the Vehicle Stability Assist (VSA) system, regardless of which VSA switch position is selected. At the driver\'s discretion, the Multi-Information Display (MID) can be configured to show the current pressure of each tire.<br> <br> <strong>Wheels and Tires</strong><br> <br> The MDX has stylish 5-spoke 18-inch aluminum-alloy wheels, with a combined machined face and pewter gray finish. Technology Package and up models have 19-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. On the Technology Package, the wheels have 10 spokes and a combined machine-face and pewter-gray finish, while the 7-spoke Advance and Entertainment Packages wheels have a cast-aluminum with medium Euro silver finish.<br> <br> The MDX comes standard with 245/60 R18 all-season tires, while the Technology Package and up models have lower-profile 245/55 R19 all-season tires for enhanced driving performance. All tires offer improved steering precision, as well as 20 percent less rolling resistance than the previous MDX\'s tires, contributing to greater fuel efficiency. For all-wheel drive MDX models, a spare tire on a steel wheel is mounted below the trunk, where it does not intrude on interior storage space (2-wheel drive trims receive a tire repair kit).<br> <br> <strong>INTERIOR</strong><br> <br> The 2014 MDX is a clean-slate design that offers a new level of luxury, convenience and technology in a spacious new cabin that\'s perfect for kids or clients. With the seven-passenger MDX\'s longer wheelbase and more compact rear suspension design, its interior packaging has been completely reworked to provide more usable and versatile passenger and cargo space, and improved third-row access.<br> <br> A new One-Touch Walk-In feature for the second-row seats, along with a 4.5-inch wider foot entry point and 1.8-inch lower step-in height, makes third-row ingress and egress easier. A new Extended Slide feature for the second-row seats provides 5.9 inches of total fore-aft seat travel, allowing for more flexibility in accommodating the needs of both second- and third-row passengers. Up front, the new center console, aided by a repackaged rear HVAC system, features a large storage area that can accommodate a medium sized purse and even a couple of tablet computers, something few competitors can match.<br> <br> High-end elements such as soft-touch materials, premium finishes, simulated wood-grain accents and satin chrome plated trim combine with an intuitive new control layout to create an upscale and user-friendly environment. Leather-trimmed (with stain resistant technology) heated power front seats are standard and offer all-day comfort along with abundant lateral support. Heated/ventilated front seats and heated rear seats, and luxurious perforated Milano leather first- and second-row seating come standard in the MDX with Advance and Entertainment Packages. A power tilt/telescoping steering wheel with enhanced fingertip controls and a multi-view rearview camera are standard on all models.<br> <br> Luxury SUV owners have high expectations for their in-vehicle information and entertainment experience. Enhanced connectivity is made possible by the MDX\'s new next-generation AcuraLink® system, with thousands of media channels available with Pandora® and Aha™ mobile, all delivered via the owner\'s internet-linked smartphone and data plan. There is also a host of available security and convenience features, including collision notification, remote unlocking, stolen vehicle tracking and surface street traffic information, all delivered via built-in cell technology.<br> <br> With the expanded range of standard and available technology features, substantial engineering effort was put into making each feature in the new MDX intuitive and easy to use. The focal point of the new instrument panel is the standard 8-inch color audio/information screen that provides a range of useful information and access to an array of customizable features.<br> <br> A 7-inch On-Demand Multi-Use Display™ positioned within easy reach of the driver and front passenger controls the audio system and many other features. The touchscreen eliminates over 30 physical buttons, and is the key contributor to the clean, uncluttered look of the new MDX interior. Dynamic menus clearly display controls for each functional mode, reduce screen clutter, and help make operation simple. Audible and haptic feedback improves usability and control, and helps the driver keep their eyes on the road. Customizable shortcuts allow the MDX driver to set easy-to-access pre-sets for Places, Phone, Climate, and Audio functional categories.<br> <br> A new spectrum of driver-assistive technologies is offered on the MDX. Technology grades feature Forward Collision Warning (FCW) and Lane Departure Warning (LDW) and Blind Spot Information (BSI) system. The Advance and Entertainment Packages has standard Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low-Speed Follow, Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS), and front and rear parking sensors.<br> <br> <strong>Design and Materials</strong><br> <br> The new MDX interior expands on Acura\'s premium luxury design themes, with clean high-end detailing, intuitive functionality and elegant lines. An Acura design concept called \"dual personal structure\" guided development of the MDX. It divides the front cabin space into areas centered on the driver and front passenger, with a center stack and console that is easily accessible to each person. Fit and finish have received close attention throughout the interior, with high-quality, soft-touch materials and available perforated Milano leather with stain resistant technology.<br> <br> <strong>Driver-Oriented Cockpit</strong><br> <br> The strategy behind the MDX\'s interior design, based on Acura\'s \"the Synergy between Man and Machine\" product direction, is to put the driver\'s needs first and foremost, to help the driver focus on operating the vehicle in an intuitive and natural way. All important systems and controls are within easy reach, and the systems used most frequently - audio, cruise control, Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink®, available satellite-linked Acura Navigation System with Voice Recognition™ and Multi-Information Display - have controls conveniently positioned on the steering wheel. The main instrumentation is an easy-to-read analog design, supplemented with digital and graphic displays.<br> <br> <strong>Leather-Wrapped Steering Wheel</strong><br> <br> The leather-wrapped steering wheel features new euro-style stitching and incorporates the most commonly used controls, allowing the driver to keep their hands on the wheel. Phone and audio controls are on the left side; cruise control and multi-info display controls are on the right side, along with the switches for Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) and Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow (on MDX with Advance and Entertainment Packages). Tucked out of view but within fingertip reach is a pair of paddle shifters that allow for manual operation of the Sequential SportShift 6-speed automatic transmission.<br> <br> <strong>Adaptive Cruise Control with Low-Speed Follow</strong><br> <br> The Advance Package features Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) with Low-Speed Follow button on the lower right side of the leather-wrapped steering wheel. This vehicle speed and distance control system uses a grill-mounted millimeter-wave radar to monitor the distance between the MDX and a detected vehicle directly ahead. Like a conventional cruise control system, the ACC system can maintain a preset speed. In addition, by combining radar data with data from speed sensors, ACC can regulate the MDX\'s speed to maintain a preset following distance interval.<br> <br> The Low-Speed Follow is a new feature to the MDX. Low-Speed Follow can reduce the driver workload in congested traffic by maintaining a selected distance interval during cruise control operation, even in stop and go traffic. If a vehicle detected ahead is in range of the system and comes to a stop, the MDX will also automatically decelerate down to a stop. When the detected vehicle moves forward, the vehicle icon on the MDX\'s multi-information display will blink. With a press of the RES/+/SET/- switch up or down, or with a press of the accelerator pedal, the MDX will automatically accelerate, resuming the Low-Speed Follow mode.<br> <br> <strong>Heated Steering Wheel (Optional)</strong><br> <br> Acura Genuine Accessories offers an optional heated steering wheel for the Acura MDX. A heating button switch mounted on the lower left side of the steering wheel can be activated when the ignition is switched on, and is also integrated to the Remote Engine Start System for automated heating.<br> <br> <strong>Instrumentation</strong><br> <br> The MDX has sophisticated analog instrumentation with large tachometer and speedometer flanking a color Multi-Information Display (MID) that provides a range of information and trip computer functions. The tachometer and speedometer are flanked by analog coolant temperature and fuel level gauges.<br> <br> <strong>Multi-Information Display</strong><br> <br> A Multi-Information Display (MID) positioned between the tachometer and speedometer gives the driver access to a range of useful information. Controls positioned on the right side of the steering wheel allow the driver to cycle the MID display through multiple screens of information from sources including Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) and more. The Maintenance Minder™ system alerts the MDX driver of upcoming maintenance needs via the MID and should a fault occur with the vehicle, specific warning information appears. On models with Navigation, the MID also provides turn-by-turn route guidance, a new feature for MDX.<br> <br> <strong>Audio/Information Screen</strong><br> <br> All MDX models feature a bright, full-color 8-inch audio/information screen positioned high in the center stack of the instrument panel. Its high placement puts it close to the driver\'s line of sight where it\'s easy to see. Besides audio system information, the screen also offers backup camera views and access to a range of customizable features.<br> <br> <strong>On-Demand Multi-Use Display™</strong><br> <br> The impressive range of technology offered in the MDX presented designers with the challenge of balancing capability with simplicity. The solution was a 7-inch On Demand Multi-Use Display™ (ODMD) touch screen positioned within easy reach of the driver and front passenger. The touchscreen controls a wide range of features, and with its contextual menus, it displays relevant items while minimizing clutter. To make it easy to use, the screen offers audible and vibratory touch feedback - both can be adjusted or shut off based on the owner\'s preference. Customizable shortcuts allow the MDX driver to set easy-to-access presets for Places, Phone, Climate and Audio functional categories.<br> <br> <strong>Multi-Angle Rearview Camera</strong><br> <br> A multi-view rearview camera is standard on all MDX grades. It offers three viewing angles (wide view, normal view and top view). Drivers may select the preferred view according to driving conditions. The rearview image is displayed on the 8-inch color audio/information display. On-screen guidelines help the driver better judge distances, and predictive guidelines help make maneuvering in reverse easier.<br> <br> <strong>Power Front Bucket Seats</strong><br> <br> Considering the luxury mission and performance of the MDX, its seating required extensive engineering development. The new front bucket seats are designed to provide comfortable support for a wide range of body types, along with secure lateral support for cornering. The seats feature luxurious leather seating surfaces, with upgraded perforated Milano leather in the MDX with Advance and Entertainment Packages. The MDX driver\'s seat features 10-way power adjustability (8-way power seat plus 2-way power lumbar support). The front passenger seat offers 8-way power adjustability standard, with 10-way power adjustability available on the MDX with Advance and Entertainment Packages. All driver\'s seat power adjustments are included in the Smart Entry system (among many other features). The system stores a pair of user profiles regarding seat settings - one for each of the two key fobs that come standard with the MDX.<br> <br> Heated front seats are standard in the MDX. A new algorithmically controlled ECU allows for three temperature settings, along with faster warm-up and smoother, more precise temperature control. The Technology and Entertainment Packages adds heated rear seats. The Advance and Entertainment Packages also includes ventilated front seats.<br> <br> <strong>Second-Row Seats with Extended Slide</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s roomy second-row seating is designed for maximum comfort and versatility, with a 60/40 split-folding design that makes it easy to accommodate passengers or long cargo. The second-row seats also have a new Extended Slide feature that provides a total of 5.9 inches of additional fore-aft seat travel (3.9 inches forward, 2 inches rear), offering passengers greater flexibility in selecting the optimal balance of second- and third-row legroom. A nearly flat floor opens up foot room for a center passenger. Also new on the 2014 MDX are five-position reclining second-row seatbacks to further aid comfort for second- and third-row passengers. There is also a padded, folding center armrest with two cupholders. In the MDX with the Technology and Entertainment Package trim and above, second-row seat heaters are standard.<br> <br> <strong>Third-Row Seats with One-Touch Walk-In Access</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s more compact rear suspension, longer wheelbase and One-Touch Walk-In feature provide for easier access to the third row. Now, even young kids will find it easy to gain access to the MDX\'s third-row seats from either side of the vehicle via the illuminated One-Touch Walk-In buttons - one button located outboard on the base of the second-row seats and a second button on the upper portion of the second-row seatback. With a single push of the electronically actuated button, the second-row seatback (left or right) folds forward and the seat automatically slides forward. To help reduce the risk of unintentional operation, the buttons will not operate unless the brake pedal is depressed or the gear selector is in Park.<br> <br> <strong>Finished Storage Space</strong><br> <br> Dual large brushed aluminum plates measuring 16.2 inches long by four inches wide protect the carpeted cargo-area floor during loading and unloading. With both second- and third-row seats folded, the cargo floor is near fully flat with only a small, 4.5-degree pitch, versus the previous MDX cargo floor, which had three varying angles of pitch.<br> <br> Even with the third-row seat in the upright position, the storage area is designed to improve the MDX\'s ability to hold bulky items, including a golf bag, stroller, two suitcases or a 56-quart cooler. Four rectangular satin-finished tie-down anchors allow securing cargo when the third-row seat is folded.<br> <br> Lifting the cargo floor panel reveals an additional hidden storage area with a cargo volume of 1.8 cu. ft. - enough to hold folding chairs (bag type) or two laptop computer cases. In addition, a handy storage bin is positioned at the left side of the cargo area behind the rear seat, with a 12-volt power outlet nearby. Two incandescent bulbs evenly illuminate the storage area.<br> <br> The third-row seats are split 50/50, and each side can be folded flat with one pull of a handle. The head restraints fold forward first, and then the seatback is unlocked so it can be folded forward easily.<br> <br> <strong>Interior Lighting</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s analog instruments are backlit with LED lighting and feature high-contrast markings, and the look of a premium chronograph. The gauge package progressively illuminates to give the driver a welcoming feel upon entry. When the door is first opened, the instrument lighting comes to life and then brightens progressively to 100-percent illumination when the ignition is switched on. The illuminated instrument panels then come alive, indicating that the MDX is ready to go. At the end of the drive, the instrument lighting dims progressively.<br> <br> The interior switches are illuminated to make them easy to locate at night, including the switches on all four doors and the steering wheel. In addition to front and rear overhead interior lights and map lights, the MDX also has a complement of low-level LED interior cabin lights. Ambient lighting in the ceiling illuminates the front center console, and the front foot wells and door handles. Entry front foot well lighting welcomes the passenger as they open the doors. The MDX interior lights feature \"theater dimming,\" which can be set by the driver to one of several dimming rates via the Multi-Information Display.<br> <br> <strong>Interior Convenience</strong><br> <br> The MDX interior offers a range of convenient storage features for the driver and passengers. All four doors offer storage bins and bottle holders, and there are cupholders on each side of the third row of seating.<br> <br> The development of a new, integrated HVAC assembly for the 2014 MDX enables the center console storage space to be enlarged significantly. About 2 inches deeper and wider, and almost 5 inches longer, the main compartment offers 2.5 times more volume than the previous generation. It\'s large enough to accommodate a moderately sized purse, a tablet computer and more. The console also features two beverage holders, a front pocket with a 12-volt outlet, a cell phone/iPod® pocket next to another 12-volt power outlet and USB Audio Interface, a sliding tray over the main storage space and another tray under the sliding, padded armrest.<br> <br> <strong>GPS-Linked, Tri-Zone Automatic Climate Control</strong><br> <br> MDX with Technology Package and up have a unique GPS-linked temperature control, tri-zone automatic climate control system that lets the driver, front passenger and rear passengers set temperatures to their individual liking.<br> <br> To operate the HVAC system, easy-to-read buttons and controls are positioned within easy reach. The HVAC system can also be controlled by voice command (MDX with Technology Package and higher grades), and additional custom settings can be accessed through the 7-inch On-Demand Multi-Use Display™.<br> <br> With its position-sensing ability, the GPS navigation system (MDX with Technology Package and higher) contributes to overall passenger comfort with a 3D solar sensing feature. Based on continuously updated vehicle position information, the navigation system determines the position of the sun relative to the driver and front passenger. Combining this information with input from a solar sensor located on top of the instrument panel, the climate control system automatically adjusts the temperature and airflow from side to side as needed to compensate for asymmetrical solar heating. Further, on the Advance and Entertainment Packages, the heated and ventilated front seats are electronically linked to the climate control system, expediting the transition to the desired temperature.<br> <br> <strong>Rear Sunshades</strong><br> <br> For increased rear-seat privacy, reduced solar loading and glare, the MDX (with Technology and Entertainment Packages and up) now has manually operated sunshades for each rear door side window.<br> <br> <strong>Active Noise Control (ANC) and Active Sound Control (ASC)</strong><br> <br> Key contributors to the MDX\'s quiet, refined interior are Active Noise Control (ANC) and Active Sound Control (ASC). The two systems are comprised of dual overhead microphones, an ANC/ASC electronic processor, and the audio system\'s speakers. ASC/ANC operates whenever the MDX engine is running, even if the audio system is turned off.<br> <br> ANC is designed to reduce low frequency sound in the cabin caused mainly by the roughness of the road surface. The overhead microphones pick up sound waves and send them to the ANC/ASC processor, which creates and sends a precisely timed \"reverse phase\" audio signal to a special amplifier. In turn, the amplifier drives the door speakers to cancel the original noise signal.<br> <br> ASC is a related technology designed to improve the engine sound quality by making the sound pressure level more linear as the engine revs increase. Typically, engine noise doesn\'t increase in a linear way with rising revs; instead there can be many resonances that create peaks and valleys in the sound pressure level, resulting in an uneven sound. ASC helps smooth out the engine sound by creating a same-phase or reverse-phase sound signal as needed and sending it to the speakers.<br> <br> <strong>AcuraLink® Connectivity System</strong><br> <br> The MDX is the second Acura model, after the 2014 RLX luxury sedan, to offer the next generation of AcuraLink®, Acura\'s cloud-based connected car system that originally launched back in 2005. AcuraLink is the new center point for owners for hands-free access to cloud-based services, audio and information, and is designed to keep MDX drivers informed and connected while on the go.<br> <br> The connectivity required for AcuraLink\'s various features is distributed between the MDX\'s embedded system (for some of the fee-based features, with Technology Package and above) and the owner\'s compatible smartphone and data package (for free features, in all MDX models). AcuraLink works with the owner\'s compatible smartphone and data package to connect the MDX with music and information resources, internet apps, and more. Aha™ by Harman is a key AcuraLink resource.<br> <br> Aha™ organizes the MDX owner\'s favorite content from the web into personalized on-demand radio stations in the vehicle. Aha™ is a comprehensive, cloud-based platform optimized for the automotive environment that provides a simple integration point for AcuraLink equipped vehicles to bring a wide range of current and future applications into the audio system head unit. This new capability allows users to access their favorite podcasts, internet and terrestrial radio, on-demand music, restaurant recommendations via Yelp, and even audio updates from Facebook and Twitter. Owners can use the AcuraLink website and smartphone apps to access information or change preferences.<br> <br> <strong>AcuraLink Service Levels</strong><br> <br> AcuraLink has three available levels of services for Technology Package MDX and up. The Standard Package comes enabled on all Acura MDX with navigation, and includes services such as surface-street and freeway traffic (free for the first three years of ownership). The subscription based Connect Package adds a wide range of capabilities, including automated crash notification and an in-vehicle Emergency System that connects you with a live Operator with the push of an overhead button. The Premium Package, which also requires a subscription, adds Live Concierge operator assistance via the MDX\'s embedded cell phone. The Concierge service can send destination information directly to the MDX navigation system, make reservations on their behalf, update the user on weather, stocks and much more.<br> <br> <strong>AcuraLink Smartphone App/Website</strong><br> <br> With an active Connect or Premium Package, the AcuraLink system gives the owner a range of features they can control or monitor remotely, via the AcuraLink Connect smartphone app or AcuraLink website.<br> <br> <strong>Aha™ by Harman</strong><br> <br> A new feature called Aha™ is accessed via AcuraLink by utilizing the owner\'s compatible smart phone. Aha™ organizes the MDX owner\'s favorite content from the web into personalized on-demand radio stations in the vehicle. Aha™ is a comprehensive, cloud-based platform optimized for the automotive environment that provides a simple integration point for AcuraLink equipped vehicles to bring a wide range of current and future applications into the audio system head unit. This new capability allows users to access their favorite podcasts, internet radio, on-demand music, restaurant recommendations, and even audio updates from Facebook and Twitter.<br> <br> <strong>Pandora® Interface</strong><br> <br> The MDX incorporates a wide range of media features to accommodate the ever-changing preferences of customers. All MDX models are designed to provide a convenient interface for Pandora®. Pandora® is a free music service that allows users to open an account online and create up to 100 personalized internet \"radio stations\" that are based on favorite songs or artists. Users can choose among their stations and listen via computer, and can also download a free smartphone Pandora® app, which allows users listen to the same list of personalized stations via their compatible phone. Although Pandora® is free, phone data charges apply.<br> <br> An iPhone or compatible Android phones can be connected to the MDX wirelessly, using Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® (iPhone is also supported via the Pandora® Audio USB interface). To use Pandora®, a compatible phone is connected (via USB or wirelessly, as appropriate) and the vehicle\'s audio source is set to Pandora® to launch the app. The audio/information screen (or navigation display in vehicles with navigation) and On-Demand Multi-Use Display™ show Pandora® information and album art, and the audio controls allow listeners to choose from among existing stations, pause, resume, skip forward, and mark a track with \"Like\" or \"Dislike\" ratings. To simplify driver use, some functionality of the Pandora® app is locked out when using the MDX\'s Pandora® interface.<br> <br> <strong>SMS Text Message Function</strong><br> <br> All MDX models have a standard SMS Text Message function that can read incoming texts aloud over the audio system, and allow the driver to reply with any of six factory preset messages, or call the sender - all without handling their phone. The system works with SMS-capable cell phones that have an active data plan and the Message Access Profile (MAP), such as the Blackberry, Droid X and others. When running iOS6, text messages received on an iPhone can be read aloud, but replies cannot be sent using the MDX interface.<br> <br> Available factory preset text replies:<br> <br> Talk to you later, I\'m driving<br> I\'m on my way<br> I\'m running late<br> OK<br> Yes<br> No<br> <br> <strong>Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® Wireless Telephone Interface</strong><br> <br> Like all Acura vehicles, the MDX has a standard Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® hands free telephone interface that is designed to work with most Bluetooth®-enabled mobile phones. Bluetooth® is a radio frequency-based technology that allows portable devices (such as mobile cellular telephones and laptop computers) to communicate wirelessly. The MDX\'s HandsFreeLink® system is compatible with Bluetooth®-enabled cellular phones that have the Hands Free Profile (HFP). After the driver completes a one-time pairing process, the MDX can communicate wirelessly and securely with the driver\'s cell phone when it is within approximately 10 feet of the car. The phone needs to be on, but can be stored in a pocket, briefcase, purse, or anywhere inside the MDX cabin.<br> <br> Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® allows the driver to send or answer telephone calls without removing their hands from the steering wheel. When a call comes in, a press of the steering wheel-mounted \"Pick up\" button mutes the audio system and the incoming caller is heard over the MDX\'s audio system speakers. Working with an overhead array microphone, the HandsFreeLink® system helps cancel \"echo effect\" and reduces background noise to improve the transmission quality of the driver\'s speech.<br> <br> To send a call hands-free, the MDX driver can dial the number by voice, again using fingertip controls mounted on the steering wheel to activate the system. The driver also can store frequently called numbers in the system\'s memory using unique voice tags. Up to six different compatible mobile phones can be registered with the MDX\'s Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® system.<br> <br> <strong>Acura 8-Speaker Audio System</strong><br> <br> The MDX comes standard with an 8-speaker Acura audio system that offers 432 watts of power, compared to the previous model\'s 253-watt system. The system has a single-disc CD player, and AM/FM/SiriusXM radio bands. Along with a physical knob for power and volume, the full range of audio system controls can be accessed using the 7-inch On-Demand Multi-Use Display™ positioned within easy reach of the driver and front-seat passenger. Controls for key audio system functions are also positioned within fingertip reach on the MDX steering wheel.<br> <br> The eight speakers are strategically located throughout the MDX cabin. Each front and rear door has a 17-cm full-range speaker. Separate 4-cm tweeters are positioned near the A-pillars, with an 8-cm speaker centered on the top of the instrument panel. A 20-cm subwoofer is mounted in a tuned 19-liter enclosure in the right sidewall of the cargo area (up from the previous MDX\'s 10-liter).<br> <br> In addition to traditional source inputs, the MDX is fitted with a USB port that allows for easy connectivity to items such as an iPod® or iPhone®, or a removable flash drive storage device containing WMA, MP3 or AAC format music. The USB port is located alongside a traditional AUX jack (that allows connectivity of an external MP3 music player) located in the center console\'s storage compartment.<br> <br> <strong>Acura/ELS® Studio 10-Speaker Audio System (MDX with Technology Package)</strong><br> <br> The MDX with Technology Package features a 10-speaker, 501-watt Acura/ELS® Studio system (compared to the 410-watt system on the previous model) that is engineered to offer impressive sound quality from a wide range of media formats. Taking the eight speakers found in the base MDX, two additional 8-cm speakers are added to the rear quarter pillar. Since this audio system is integrated with the Acura Navigation System, it features hard drive music storage and Song By Voice. The Acura/ELS® Studio audio system offers the same intuitive touchscreen and steering-wheel mounted controls as the base MDX audio system, plus select audio system functions can also be accomplished via voice command.<br> <br> Engineered specifically for the MDX, the system has a single-disc CD player, AM/FM/HD Radio/XM/HDD audio source options, and delivers detailed, well-balanced sound to all seating positions. The system gets its name from multi-Grammy® Award winning producer/engineer Elliot Scheiner\'s recording industry-recognized moniker \"ELS®.\" Scheiner\'s goal in the development of this audio system was to reproduce music the way it is heard in the recording studio.<br> <br> Acura/ELS® Studio 11-Speaker Audio System (MDX with Technology and Entertainment Packages)<br> <br> The MDX with Technology and Entertainment Packages features an upgraded 529-watt 11-speaker Acura/ELS® Studio Audio System. An 8-cm roof speaker is added above the second-row seating.<br> <br> The MDX with Technology and Entertainment Package includes a factory-installed Acura DVD Rear Entertainment System (RES) for rear passengers with a 9-inch wide-screen LCD display that flips down from the ceiling for easy viewing. The WVGA display natively provides 800 pixels horizontally and 480 pixels vertically. User-selectable aspect ratios include normal, wide and zoom. The extended capabilities of the system allow for either DVD, CD, radio, SiriusXM® Radio and auxiliary accessories (such as certain video game consoles, DVD players or cameras) to be played in the rear seating areas through headphones while the front passengers listen to a different audio source.<br> <br> The DVD player can be conveniently controlled from three sources - the front audio-system controls, the integrated wireless remote control (that is stored in the ceiling near the LCD screen), or through voice activation. The DVD disc will begin to auto-play when the disc is loaded. Additional audio and video input jacks allow for a wide variety of additional equipment to be attached to the system. The system comes complete with two infrared (IR) wireless headphones and a wireless remote control as standard equipment. For convenient night use, the remote control is illuminated.<br> <br> Two wireless headphones are included. Each includes a volume knob. A safety feature on the wireless headphone system prevents front-row passengers from using the headphones. The wireless headphones are automatically activated when the ear pieces are turned approximately 90 degrees (to be put on) and deactivated when the headphones are turned 90 degrees (when taken off). The automatic on/off system reduces the possibility that the AAA battery-powered headphones could be accidentally left on. A 115-volt power outlet rated for devices up to 150 watts, such as a gaming console or laptop, is included.<br> <br> <strong>Acura/ELS® Studio 12-Speaker Audio System</strong><br> <br> The MDX with Advance and Entertainment Packages features a 546-watt Acura/ELS® Studio Audio System with 12-speakers. This Elliot Scheiner-engineered system is designed to recreate the emotional experience you feel when you enjoy a live performance, regardless of where you are seated in the MDX\'s spacious interior.<br> <br> The system has a total of 12 speakers. Each front and rear door has a 17cm full-range speaker. Separate 4 cm tweeters are positioned near the A-pillars, with an 8-cm speaker centered on the top of the instrument panel. At the rear of the MDX, there are two 8-cm speakers on the rear pillars and a 20-cm subwoofer mounted in a tuned enclosure in the right sidewall of the cargo area. For improved surround sound imaging, there are two additional 8-cm speakers mounted in the headliner, over the second row of seating as a part of the RES System.<br> <br> <strong>Ultra-Wide DVD Rear Entertainment System (MDX with Advance and Entertainment Packages)</strong><br> <br> The state-of-the-art, factory-integrated Rear Entertainment System (RES) features a 16.2-inch wide display, the largest ever offered in an Acura. The WVGA display natively provides 1,600 pixels horizontally and 480 pixels vertically. User-selectable aspect ratios include normal (640x480), full (850x480), super full (1,300x480), ultra full (1,600x480), super zoom (1,300x640) and ultra zoom (1600x640). The system can simultaneously show two different sources of programming side-by-side, such as a video game and a movie. The two programs being played can be easily switched from side to side using a button near the screen. The 605-watt audio system provides 5.1 channel surround sound capability. The dual-source wireless headphones supplied with this system can be tuned to either input source as desired using a button on each set of headphones. The system includes a High Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI) port for attaching high-definition players and certain gaming consoles, along with standard composite and audio inputs. A 115-volt power outlet rated for devices up to 150 watts is included.<br> <br> <strong>SiriusXM® Radio</strong><br> <br> SiriusXM® Radio is a standard feature on all Acura MDX models and provides more than 140 channels of digital programming with near CD-quality sound. The SiriusXM® signal is beamed to two broadcast satellites positioned in geostationary orbit above Earth. The beams from these two broadcast satellites combine to span the entire continental United States and some of Canada.<br> <br> SiriusXM® Radio programming includes channels devoted to music, sports, talk, traffic, weather, children\'s programming and entertainment. Of the more than 140 SiriusXM® channels, 71 are commercial-free. When the MDX\'s audio system plays SiriusXM® Radio, the Audio/Information screen (or navigation display in vehicles with navigation) displays the current category, station song title, or artist\'s name, while the current category and station are also displayed on the On-Demand Multi-Use Display™.<br> <br> A complimentary three-month subscription to the SiriusXM® Radio service is included with purchase of a new MDX, and customers are able to continue the service or cancel any time afterwards.<br> <br> <strong>HD Radio™ (Technology Package and above)</strong><br> <br> MDX models with the Technology Package and above feature standard HD Radio™. HD Radio™ provides advanced audio and data features that enhance the listening experience. Sound quality is improved with HD Radio™ and there is no subscription fee.<br> <br> Instead of sending out one analog signal, HD Radio™ stations send out a bundled signal - both analog and digital. Because it is digital, textual data such as song titles can be sent out as well. Unlike conventional radio, HD Radio™ stations broadcast extra channels, which are called HD2/HD3. These added channels offer MDX owners a universe of additional choices.<br> <br> <strong>Hard Disk Drive (HDD) Audio (Technology Package and above)</strong><br> <br> MDX models with the Technology Package and above feature a standard Hard Disk Drive (HDD) system with 16 GB of storage for audio. The system can copy music tracks from pre-recorded CDs, enabling owners to store music on-board for easy access. The system will not copy music from burned CDs or from USB flash drives. Based on music files measuring an average size of 4.2MB per song at a 128kbps bit rate, approximately 3,900 songs (approximately 200 CDs) can be loaded onto the available 16 GB of storage.<br> <br> The HDD-based system records music at 6-times that of the original music track time. Two recording quality settings (192 kbps or 128 kbps) are available. The automatic-recording default setting can be changed to manual if desired.<br> <br> The audio system can display information about the music tracks, such as artist names and song titles, using the Gracenote® database in the system software. This database can be periodically updated to reflect newly released music. Gracenote updates can be downloaded by MDX owners at automobiles.acura.com in the Ownerlink section (up to four updates per year maximum). The updates can then be loaded onto a CD-R or onto a USB thumb drive, which in turn can be used to update the MDX audio system. Even without a Gracenote update, newly released audio tracks will play on the sound system, without accompanying text information on genre, artist, album name and track name.<br> <br> <strong>Song By Voice®</strong><br> <br> MDX models with the Technology Package and above are also equipped with the Song by Voice® feature. With so much audio content potentially available on the HDD or from an iPod or compatible smartphone, MDX engineers set out to make it easy to find content. From most navigation screens, the driver can simply press the TALK button on the steering wheel and give a voice command, such as \"Play song \'Danny Boy,\'\" and the system will search all available content on the HDD and connected iPod and compatible smartphone, and automatically begin playback. Song by Voice also lets the driver choose music by artist, album, track name, genre, playlist and even composer.<br> <br> <strong>Acura Navigation System with Voice Recognition</strong><br> <br> MDX models with the Technology Package and above feature the latest generation Acura Navigation System with Voice Recognition™ (available in all 50 United States as well as Puerto Rico, Canada and Mexico).<br> <br> <strong>System Operation</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s available Acura Satellite-Linked Navigation System uses GPS technology and a 100 GB hard disk drive-based (HDD) system to provide drivers with turn-by-turn guidance to their chosen destination. The system now includes surface street traffic data and provides coverage in many areas within the U.S., allowing the driver to choose faster, less congested routes. The system offers a new level of convenience with the new generation of AcuraLink. Owners can send a destination to the vehicle in advance of a trip using AcuraLink (with the available Connect Package), or while on the road via the AcuraLink Concierge operator (with the optional Premium Package) or the interactive voice response system (with the AcuraLink Connect Package). Faster, more capable and easier to use than any previous-generation Acura system, the MDX navigation system sets a new standard.<br> <br> The MDX navigation system utilizes the 8-inch high-resolution WVGA (800x480 pixel) backlit color display. The system can be controlled by voice, or with a convenient interface dial. The voice-activated system responds to casual command phrases that require less user familiarization, in addition to the previous capability of being able to understand spoken city and street names. For example, a voice request for \"Radio 98.3 FM\" can now be spoken in approximately a dozen different ways ranging from \"change the radio station to 98.3\" to \"98.3 FM.\" This logic applies to audio functionality of the audio/information screen. The navigation system can also be controlled by voice with conventional navigation commands like, \"Find nearest Chinese restaurant\" or \"find nearest ATM.\"<br> <br> The audio system is automatically muted when the \"Talk\" button is pressed. The voice-recognition technology allows the driver to simply speak city and street names aloud, and the system responds by displaying the matches available in the database. Points of interest on the map (such as restaurants or grocery stores) can be displayed with brand logo icons, or the system can provide turn-by-turn navigation - all by voice command. The point-of-interest (POI) database, with more than 10 million points, includes telephone numbers that can be dialed by using the Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® system when the driver\'s cellular telephone is connected to the system.<br> <br> The MDX\'s navigation screen can display regularly updated traffic information including traffic flow, incidents and construction on freeways, and on surface streets. The information is from Probe Traffic, a system that tracks the movements of participating Acura (and other) vehicles to generate up-to-date flow information. Participants opt into the Probe Traffic system to receive flow information, which is anonymous and scrubbed of any personal information. The flow information is transmitted via the MDX\'s embedded cellular data link and is graphically displayed on the navigation system.<br> <br> When traffic congestion or road incidents are detected along the selected drive route, the system will automatically recalculate a \"detour\" route and display a pop-up box signifying the route change. Alternately, the driver can recalculate a route in manual mode simply by selecting \"TRAFFIC INCIDENTS\" from the Map Info menu followed by selecting the \"AVOID\" command relevant to an incident.<br> <br> A digital version of the Zagat Survey® restaurant guide provides detailed information and reviews on select restaurants in the database. The reviews can be read on-screen or spoken over the audio system by a synthesized voice. The navigation system can also suggest scenic routes based on the National Scenic Byways and All-American Roads guide.<br> <br> <strong>Smart Entry Keyless Access System</strong><br> <br> Acura\'s Smart Entry with Push Button Start comes standard on the MDX. The Smart Entry system lets the MDX owner gain access to the vehicle\'s front doors and rear hatch without having to operate the key fob or conventional key. The Smart Entry remote has a unique digital identity and the MDX can be unlocked when the driver pulls one of the front door handles (Technology Package and above adds rear door access) while the remote is in their possession. When carrying the fob (or if all doors are unlocked), the rear tailgate can be opened by pressing a button located on the MDX\'s rear fascia.<br> <br> Once the driver has opened the door and is seated, the Smart Entry system allows the MDX to be started by pushing the Engine Start/Stop button positioned on the instrument panel. When leaving the car, a press of the soft-touch button on the exterior door handle locks all the doors. Alternatively, pressing the Lock button on the Smart Entry remote will also simultaneously lock all doors.<br> <br> <strong>Remote Preferences</strong><br> <br> The Acura MDX comes with two keyless remotes that can be set with a unique preference to accommodate the preferences of two different drivers. The available preferences include driver seat, steering wheel and mirror positions, along with select HVAC functions. Other preferences include turning entry lights on or off, audio system pre-sets, air conditioning preferences, and navigation system settings. In the event both owners use the car at the same time, the MDX will recognize the keyless remote that approaches the vehicle first.<br> <br> <strong>SAFETY</strong><br> <br> The 2014 Acura MDX is designed to provide high levels of both active and passive safety protection. With its all-new unit-body design featuring numerous energy-absorbing crumple zones and anti-intrusion features, it is projected to earn the highest possible safety ratings: a five star Overall Vehicle Score from the federal National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), and a TOP SAFETY PICK+ rating from the independent Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), including a GOOD rating in the Institute\'s stringent new small overlap frontal collision test.<br> <br> Safety advances begin with the new next-generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure. This supercomputer-designed structure is designed to increase the amount of protection provide to MDX occupants in frontal collisions, and is expected to help the MDX garner top performance ratings in the rigorous new IIHS small overlap front crash test. The use of premium materials such as hot-stamped steel and magnesium make the MDX body structure more rigid, while also contributing to a 275-pound lower curb weight compared to the previous generation vehicle.<br> <br> <strong>Next-Generation Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) Body Structure</strong><br> <br> The MDX\'s enhanced Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure is the second generation of Acura\'s proprietary ACE structural design. ACE is an exclusive body design that enhances occupant protection and crash compatibility in frontal crashes. It uses a network of connected structural elements to distribute crash energy more evenly throughout the front of the vehicle, helping to reduce the forces transferred to the passenger compartment. It can help to more evenly disperse the forces transferred to other vehicles in a crash as well. ACE also helps reduce the chances that one vehicle will override another, improving crash compatibility of vehicles that differ in size. ACE goes further by offering additional strength and protection in small overlap frontal collisions, which are among the most severe.<br> <br> <strong>Forward Collision Warning (FCW)</strong><br> <br> Forward Collision Warning (FCW) uses either a camera mounted in the upper portion of the windshield (Technology Package, Technology and Entertainment Packages) or the CMBS radar (Advance and Entertainment Packages) to detect vehicles ahead and to determine whether a collision is likely. This reduces the stress of driving in traffic, while also contributing to an increased level of passive safety.<br> <br> If the FCW system detects a vehicle in front of the MDX and then determines that a collision may occur (due to a speed differential between the two vehicles), it will trigger visual and audible alerts for the driver. These include a \"BRAKE\" message on the Multi-Information Display (MID), and on the Advance and Entertainment Packages, a secondary visual warning on the windshield via the heads-up display, and a series of beeps to alert the driver to apply the brake pedal. The FCW system will not automatically brake, and the driver remains responsible for safely operating the vehicle and avoiding collisions.<br> <br> Drivers may adjust the distance at which FCW alerts occur by pressing the \"SETTINGS\" button, selecting \"Vehicle Settings,\" and then choosing \"Driver Assist System Setup\" and the \"Forward Collision Warning Distance\" option. At this point they may choose between \"Long,\" \"Normal\" or \"Short.\" And if they choose to, drivers may also select \"Off\" to disable the FCW system entirely.<br> <br> Note that the FCW system cannot detect all objects ahead and may not detect a given object; accuracy will vary based on weather, speed and other factors.<br> <br> <strong>Lane Departure Warning (LDW)</strong><br> <br> Included in the Technology Packages and up, the new Lane Departure Warning (LDW) system is designed to alert the driver if the vehicle is leaving a detected lane without the turn signal being activated. The system functions at speeds from 45 to 90 mph on straight or slightly curved roads, alerting the driver of any deviations from a detected road.<br> <br> In the Technology and Technology and Entertainment Packages, LDW uses the same upper front windshield camera as the Frontal Collision Warning (FCW) system. In the Advance and Entertainment Packages, LDW uses the Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) camera. Regardless of which camera is utilized, the camera is designed to recognize lane markings so the system can detect when the vehicle is about to leave its lane.<br> <br> If the vehicle begins to move out of a detected lane without the turn signal activated, LDW illuminates a Lane Departure message on the Multi-Information Display (MID) and sounds a series of beeps, advising the driver to take appropriate action. Unlike LKAS, the LDW system is passive and does not provide any steering input or correction. The driver may turn the system off by pressing the LDW button located on the instrument panel, left of the steering column.<br> <br> There are certain conditions under which the system may not engage or operate, including inclement weather (e.g., snow, ice or heavy rain) and extreme cabin heat conditions. It will automatically suspend operation when the brakes are applied or the turn signals are used. LDW may not detect all lane markings or lane departures; accuracy will vary based on weather, speed and road condition. The driver remains responsible for safely operating the vehicle and avoiding collisions.<br> <br> <strong>Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS)</strong><br> <br> The Acura MDX\'s Advance Package features Lane Keeping Assist System (LKAS) to provide a less stressful driving experience by reducing steering correction movements and driving effort on the highway. LKAS uses a camera to read lane markings to assist the driver in driving in the middle of the lane.<br> <br> Designed for the U.S. road structure, the system uses a camera mounted on the upper portion of the windshield to identify painted lanes, Botts\' Dots and Cat Eye markers at speeds between 45 mph and 90 mph. When LKAS senses that the driver is drifting from the middle of a detected lane, the system generates counteracting steering torque to assist the driver in maintaining lane position, while also displaying a visual warning in the MID within the instrument panel to alert the driver about a potential lane departure. Compared to lane-keeping systems on other vehicles, the MDX\'s LKAS operates in a more linear fashion with a more natural feel.<br> <br> <strong>Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS)</strong><br> <br> Included in the Advance Package, the Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS™) is one of the most sophisticated driver-assistive technologies available. It continually scans traffic conditions ahead of the MDX, alerts the driver of a potential collision, and then takes proactive action to help reduce collision forces if one becomes unavoidable.<br> <br> Unlike the pre-collision systems on some vehicles, CMBS can automatically apply the brakes to help reduce the severity of a collision. When CMBS detects a potential collision, visual, audible and tactile (driver and front passenger seatbelt pre-tensioning) alerts first prompt the driver to take corrective actions. If the system determines that a collision is imminent, it applies the brakes to help reduce vehicle speed and collision forces.<br> <br> It is important to note that CMBS cannot detect all objects ahead, nor is it intended to replace the driver\'s assessment of traffic conditions and control of the vehicle. The driver must intervene in certain situations, and must always be attentive when using the system. In addition, CMBS is not intended to apply enough braking force to prevent a collision. The system also may not perform all visual-, audible- and tactile-alert stages, and may instead automatically engage the brakes if the system deems it necessary.<br> <br> <strong>Pedestrian Injury Mitigation</strong><br> <br> The MDX has an impact-absorbing front body design to help reduce injury in the event of a frontal collision with a pedestrian. Research shows that the following features can dramatically improve a pedestrian\'s chance of survival if struck by a moving vehicle:<br> <br> Impact-energy absorbing hood - Space is provided between the underside of the hood and key powertrain components, allowing the hood to bend and deform if contact is made with either an adult or a child pedestrian.<br> Energy-absorbing fender mounts and supports - Front fender mounts and brackets are designed to deform easily to help absorb impact energy.<br> Deformable windshield wiper pivots - Wiper pivots are designed to deform and break away easily. <br> <br> <strong>Airbags</strong><br> <br> A total of seven airbags, including dual-stage, multiple-threshold front airbags, front side airbags, side-curtain airbags, and a new driver\'s side knee airbag, are standard on the 2014 MDX.<br> <br> Driver\'s Side Knee Airbag<br> <br> New for the MDX is a driver\'s side knee airbag designed to better position the driver in the event of a frontal collision so that the front airbag and seatbelts can have maximum effect. The knee airbag is contained beneath a panel on the underside of the instrument panel, which is contoured away from the knees to provide as much clearance as possible for comfort.<br> <br> <strong>Dual-Stage, Multiple-Threshold Front Airbags (SRS)</strong><br> <br> Every MDX is equipped with dual-stage, multiple-threshold front airbags (SRS). One or both of these airbags will be deployed only in the event of a sufficient frontal impact. If deployed, the airbags are capable of being inflated at different rates depending on crash severity, seat-belt usage and other factors. Front airbags are designed to supplement the seat belts to help reduce the likelihood of head and upper body injuries in frontal crashes.<br> <br> <strong>Front Passenger Airbag-Off Indicator</strong><br> <br> An indicator light marked \"PASS AIRBAG,\" located on the right of the upper display illuminates to indicate that the passenger\'s front airbag is off and will not deploy during a frontal impact. This happens when the weight of the front-seat passenger, or an object on the seat, is 63.8 pounds or less.<br> <br> Driver and Front Passenger Side Airbags<br> <br> Driver\'s and front passenger\'s SmartVent™ side airbags mounted in the outboard area of each front seatback are designed to help provide pelvis and thorax protection in the event of a severe side impact. The advanced design allows the side airbags to inflate with a low risk of injuring the seat occupant while deploying. This eliminates the need for the previous-generation MDX\'s Occupant Position Detection System (OPDS).<br> <br> <strong>Side Curtain Airbags</strong><br> <br> All outboard seating positions include a side curtain airbag system. The side curtain airbags deploy from modules in the roof in the event of a sufficient side impact or rollover, providing a significant level of head protection in the window area. The new side curtain airbags now have a wider deployment profile and remains fully deployed for an extended time to enhance ejection mitigation. This application is two years in advance of new safety regulations taking effect in 2015.<br> <br> <strong>E-Pretensioner Front Seatbelts (Advance and Entertainment Packages)</strong><br> <br> Another new MDX safety feature available on the Advance Package is a driver and front passenger seatbelt e-pretensioner system that detects yaw rate. During normal driving conditions, the e-pretensioner system provides a \"tensionless\" seatbelt experience, enhancing driving comfort. Then during sporty or aggressive driving, the system uses electronic controls to tighten the seatbelts.<br> <br> In addition, the e-pretensioner system tightens and holds the seatbelts during sudden steering inputs like those that may occur during a skid or a minor collision. The e-pretensioner system is fully automatic and requires no intervention from the driver or front passenger, aside from the initial fastening of the seatbelt.<br> <br> <strong>Adjustable Head Restraints</strong><br> <br> The first and second row (with the exception of the center in the second row) seating positions feature individually adjustable head restraints. The head restraints for the third row seats fold automatically when the seat fold-down handle is pulled, simplifying the process of converting the Acura MDX into cargo-hauling mode. The headrests can also be folded down independently, improving rear visibility.<br> Acura MDX (2014)<br>','[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_4.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_5.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_6.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_7.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_8.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_9.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_10.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_11.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_12.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_14.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_16.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_17.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_19.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_21.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_13.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_15.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_18.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_20.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_22.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_23.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_24.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_25.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_26.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_27.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_28.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_29.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_30.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_31.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_32.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_33.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_34.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_35.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_36.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-MDX-4836_37.jpg\"]','2024-10-23 05:32:36','2024-10-23 05:32:36'),(26,'15802e3b','https://www.autoevolution.com/cars/acura-ilx-2012.html',2,'ACURA ILX 2012-2014 Photos, engines &amp; full specs ','<p></p><p>Based on the Honda Civic, the longer and wider compact sedan had an unique styling that differentiated it a lot from the Honda sibling.</p><p>Designed mostly for those who wanted to have an elegant, yet sporty sedan, the ILX was smaller and cheaper than the TSX.</p><p>For 2013, the ILX was available in a single sedan body style and a choice of three engines, depending on the trim level.</p><p>The base ILX was equipped with a 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine mated with a 5-speed automatic transmission. </p><p>The 2.4 trim level, obviously featured a large and more powerful 2.4-liter powerplant that developed 201 hp and 170 lb.-ft of torque.

a technologically advanced vehicle, but the Japanese carmaker thought it needed a refresh in 2009, after four years on the market.</strong></p><p></p><p>Honda was still struggling to came back on its feet after the world financial crisis, when it had to cut some models from its lineup around the world, but the American car market helped it find its balance. The MDX was a top seller and, after the 2009 refresh, it became the most sold Acura on the North-American market and overtook its brother, the TL.</p><p>The MDX exterior was already known and pleasant, but Acura\'s design team changed its front grille to match the rest of the range. For the 2009 model, the MDX adopted a grille with a wide slat at the front instead of the two-slats style featured on the non-facelifted version. A pair of air-intakes made their way into the bottom of the spoiler. In the back, Honda installed LED taillights for its Premium compact SUV.</p><p>Inside, the MDX featured three rows of seats fitted as standard and leather-wrapped interior. The carmaker installed a rear-view camera with a small screen inside the rear-view mirror for the base model. For the upper trim levels, the image was sent to the navigation display.</p><p>But Acura added more goodies on the technical side with the introduction of a long-waited 6-speed automatic gearbox. The engine was tweaked to offer 300 hp from the 3.7-liter V6 under the hood, thanks to a higher compression ratio. On top of that, it added adaptive suspension, which improved the handling.</p>','<strong>The award-winning Acura MDX luxury SUV sets even higher standards in 2010 for styling, performance, technology and safety. For 2010, the Acura MDX features a fresh new exterior look, revised powertrain that includes a new 6-speed automatic, chassis refinements, more comfort, and improved technology along with the introduction of an all-new Advance Package - making the class leader even better.</strong><br> <br> \"Already considered by many as the benchmark in its class, the new 2010 MDX significantly raises the bar yet again,\" said Jeff Conrad, vice president of Acura sales. \"Fresh looks, an all-new 6-speed transmission and lots of new customer relevant technology make the Acura MDX an even smarter SUV choice than ever.\"<br> <br> Visually, the 7-passenger 2010 Acura MDX receives more aggressive styling in the form of new front and rear bodywork, a bold new front grille and numerous new trim enhancements. Under the hood, the Acura MDX receives a more refined 3.7L V-6 engine that teams with an all-new 6-speed automatic transmission for better performance and improved fuel efficiency. Inside, the Acura MDX receives a host of new features and technologies that make it even more luxurious.<br> <br> Ride and handling have been enhanced as a result of a revised power steering system, stiffer rear trailing arm mounting, body rigidity improvements and reduced overall NVH. Thanks to Acura\'s exclusive Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®) system, the Acura MDX\'s handling provides confident on- and off-road handling in addition to excellent foul weather performance.<br> <br> To expand the dynamic capabilities for 2010 MDX, a new Advance package, with a revised Active Damper System and larger 19-inch wheels and tires, further enhances handling while retaining the comfortable, quiet and controlled ride quality expected of a luxury vehicle.<br> <br> The 2010 Acura MDX exterior gets a fresh new look as a result of Acura\'s signature design front grille, a new front fascia, revised hood, new side sills, a new rear fascia matched with rolled edge polished stainless-steel exhaust finishers, revised taillights with brighter LED lights, many new trim pieces and available 19-inch diameter 7-spoke aluminum-alloy wheels.<br> <br> Inside, the 2010 MDX benefits from the expanded use of Milano leather, a new thicker sport steering wheel with racing-inspired paddle shifters, new gauges, easier to understand button placement for center stack functions, available ventilated front seats and upgraded interior trim. In addition, a host of new technology is available including AcuraLink Real-Time Weather™ and Traffic Rerouting™. Other available features include a new full VGA 8-inch navigation screen, a new rear view camera with three unique view choices, upgraded rear entertainment system, an updated audio system with a dedicated 15 GB hard disk drive (HDD) and USB port connectivity, even more LED lighting - and the list goes on.<br> <br> In keeping with Acura\'s leadership in the application of advanced, customer-relevant features, the 2010 Acura MDX is available with an array of technologies to improve convenience, including an all-new blind spot information system and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), and enhance safety, with Acura\'s unique Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS™).<br> <br> <strong>Powertrain</strong><br> <br> For 2010 the Acura MDX receives a new 3.7-liter VTEC® V-6. The engine continues Acura\'s longstanding mission to provide V-8 level horsepower and torque while retaining the size and fuel efficiency of a V-6. Based on the previous Acura MDX\'s powerplant, the newly refined 3.7L V-6 develops 300 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque to provide immediate throttle response, outstanding low- and mid-range torque and excellent high-rpm power. To widen the powerband while simultaneously improving fuel efficiency, the latest 3.7-liter engine has the patented Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control (VTEC®) system applied to the intake valves, revised high-lift camshaft specs during VTEC® operation, a computer controlled dual-stage induction system and an electronic Drive-by-Wire™ throttle system.<br> <br> Internally, the new 3.7L V-6 makes use of special heavy-duty components including a more rigid cylinder block, high-strength crankshaft, heavy-duty connecting rods, high compression-ratio pistons, cylinder heads with improved cooling, new intake valve springs, a new EGR system, unique long-reach spark plugs, a larger throttle body and other features.<br> <br> EPA estimated city/highway fuel mileage of 16/21 mpg (an improvement of 1 mpg city and 1 mpg highway over the 2009 model) and a large 21-gallon fuel capacity mean the Acura MDX is perfect for long drives. Like all 2010 Acura vehicles, the MDX complies with the latest EPA TIER 2 - BIN 5 and CARB LEV II ULEV emissions standards.<br> <br> The 3.7L V-6 is coupled with a brand-new Sequential SportShift 6-speed automatic transmission along with a new multi-clutch torque converter. With comparatively \"short\" gearing in the first five forward gears, acceleration is enhanced - while fuel efficiency and quiet cruising are optimized with a relaxed Sixth gear ratio. The transmission offers two automatic shift modes, or can be operated manually via racing-inspired steering wheel paddle shifters. Grade Logic Control, Shift Hold Control, Cornering G Shift Control and Hill Start Assist make the new 6-speed the most advanced automatic transmission ever offered by Acura. To support the Acura MDX\'s 5,000 pound towing capacity, a special front-mount transmission fluid cooler is employed.<br> <br> The Acura MDX puts power to the ground through Acura\'s acclaimed Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®) system, an innovative full-time all-wheel-drive system that uses torque vectoring to actively distribute the optimum amount of power not only between the front and rear axles, but also between the left and right rear wheels. With torque vectoring (and by selectively overdriving the outside rear wheel while cornering) the yaw moment of the Acura MDX can be controlled throughout a turn as the SH-AWD® system reduces understeer to greatly enhance handling precision and ultimate cornering ability. Working in conjunction with the Acura MDX\'s standard Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) with traction control, SH-AWD® provides enhanced power delivery and driver control whether it be on-road or off-road, in dry, rain, snow or ice.<br> <br> When towing, special Trailer Stability Assist algorithms built into the VSA® logic help stabilize the vehicle after sensing oscillations of the vehicle or trailer. The Acura MDX\'s SH-AWD® system is further enhanced with hill logic that automatically adjusts the front/rear torque distribution based on the incline of the hill grades.<br> <br> <strong>Chassis</strong><br> <br> With an emphasis on top-level handling performance, Acura MDX engineers targeted the world-class dynamics and driving feel of the top European SUV competitors. This led to the development of a long wheelbase platform and a sophisticated suspension system tuned at Germany\'s famed Nürburgring race circuit.<br> <br> The Acura MDX\'s 4-wheel fully-independent suspension makes use of MacPherson struts in front teamed with a multi-link rear suspension design that is mounted to a rigid unit body structure with isolated subframes. The front suspension also uses unique hydro-compliance bushings that provide superior ride isolation and chassis vibration control. The rear suspension features aluminum-alloy uprights to reduce unsprung weight for improved response, while special trailing-arm mounting points reduce body squat during acceleration. For 2010, the Acura MDX uses stiffer rear trailing arm mounts, incorporates numerous body rigidity improvements and delivers reduced overall NVH.<br> <br> As part of the available Advance Package, the Active Damper System gives the 2010 Acura MDX an elevated level of handling precision designed to satisfy the most discriminating drivers - all while maintaining a smooth ride. The Acura MDX\'s Active Damper System features a new algorithm which provides two driver-selectable settings -Comfort and Sport -that tailor the suspension dampers for a more comfortable or more sporting ride. For 2010, the Active Dampers have been re-tuned for provide a more refined ride for Comfort mode and a more natural feeling Sport mode.<br> <br> Using \"active\" Magneto-Rheological fluid dampers and predictive computer algorithms, the Acura MDX\'s Active Damper System can respond in as little as five milliseconds (0.005 sec.) to individually adjust the damping force of the shock absorbers ahead of actual body movements to provide improved transient handling, road isolation and body control.<br> <br> The Comfort mode allows for a more relaxed driving experience by prioritizing road isolation and reduced passenger fatigue caused by road inputs, while the Sport mode prioritizes handling response and vehicle body control to allow for spirited driving with high levels of precision and vehicle composure.<br> <br> For 2010, new (lighter) 18-inch diameter 5-spoke aluminum-alloy wheels are standard with 19-inch diameter 7-spoke aluminum-alloy wheels available as part of the Advance Package.<br> <br> For excellent stopping power and control, the Acura MDX employs large 13.0-inch diameter ventilated front brake rotors and 13.2-inch solid rear brake rotors along with anti-lock brakes (ABS) with Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) and Brake Assist.<br> <br> <strong>Interior</strong><br> <br> For 2010, new attention to detail and added luxury further distinguish the Acura MDX interior. Expanded use of Milano premium leather to the available Technology Package, improved look and feel of interior trim materials, relocated front seat headrests for improved comfort, more detailed leather stitching (such as the Lancia-style stitching on the steering wheel and shift knob), thicker steering wheel grip, increased use of LED interior lighting and revised cockpit controls make it clear that the Acura MDX is focused on the driver - but not at the expense of passenger comfort.<br> <br> The power driver seat adjusts 10 ways for optimum comfort, and the front passenger seat is 8-way power adjustable. The second-row outboard seats mirror the style and lateral support of the front seats, giving the interior a unique feel that highlights the Acura MDX\'s blend of sport and utility. Convenience and cargo features abound, including under-floor storage in the rear cargo area and a standard power-operated rear tailgate. There are multiple configurations of the Acura MDX\'s three rows of seating thus enabling a maximum useable cargo volume of 83.5 cubic feet.

The sedan version was already on the market since 2008, but without a station-wagon shape to cover a young family\'s needs, it was difficult for Acura to increase its sales. The design-team from the badge-engineering department didn\'t tear a sweat when they made it.</p><p>At the front, the TSX Sport Wagon sported the specific Acura grille with a fat chromed slat at the top, under the hood\'s edge. At the bottom, the side scoops were adorned with silver covers around the fog lights. At the rear, the station wagon received a new set of revised taillights and a rear license plate garnish that added more visual appeal for the TSX.</p><p>Like the rest of the TSX range, the 2011 models received more visual upgrades. It sported a refreshed design for the centers stack with darker trims, silver door handles, and a new steering wheel. For the rear seats, Acura installed a set of vents for heating and cooling. In its station wagon shape, the TSX offered 472 liters (16.7 cu-ft) of space with seats up and up to 1.713 liters (60.5 cu-ft) with the rear bench folded.</p><p>Unlike its European sibling, Honda offered the 2011 Acura TSX Sport Wagon with a choice of two engines: the 2.4-liter inline-four and a 3.5-liter V-6. While the former was available with a six-speed manual and a five-speed automatic as an option, the latter featured a standard five-speed automatic.</p>','<strong>&nbsp;Despite the TSX being a top choice in its class, Acura has not rested on its laurels, as a host of major updates have been made for 2011. Topping the list, the Acura TSX receives a freshened exterior look along with a wide array of new features and technology - with particular attention being paid to further improving quality and cabin quietness. In addition, significant improvements have been made to both the 2.4L I-4 and 3.5L V-6 engines that yield improved fuel efficiency and longer engine life.</strong><br> <br> While the TSX sedan receives significant updates for 2011, the big news is an all-new TSX variant - the Acura TSX Sport Wagon. With crisp styling and added utility, the Acura TSX Sport Wagon is a smart alternative for those considering a compact SUV. Besides offering better fuel economy, the Acura TSX Sport Wagon provides comparable cargo area to many compact SUVs. Plus, the Acura TSX Sport Wagon offers a multi-configurable rear cargo area (with numerous hidden storage areas), a low lift-over height allowing for easy loading and unloading, and an available power actuated tailgate.<br> <br> \"The all-new Acura TSX Sport Wagon is a smart alternative for those needing added utility,\" said Jeff Conrad, vice president of Acura sales. \"With the Sport Wagon, the customer simultaneously enjoys the benefits of sports-sedan performance along with SUV-like cargo capacity.\"<br> <br> Acura\'s philosophy of smart luxury is well evidenced by the combination of great looks, a luxury interior available with a wide variety of technology features, and excellent safety - all for an exceptional level of value. Thanks to this great mix of attributes, the TSX has the largest percentage of buyers under 30 among all luxury sedans and has remained the volume leader within its segment according to Global Insight.<br> <br> Exterior<br> <br> On the outside, all TSX models receive a new front fascia, revised chin spoiler, new fog light garnish assembly and an updated grille. The updated front end teams with new underbody panels to improve aerodynamics. At the rear, revised taillights and a rear license plate garnish add more visual appeal for the TSX.<br> <br> With the new Sport Wagon model, sport-sedan styling and added utility are combined- a perfect mix for those who lead an active lifestyle. For such customers, the Acura TSX Sport Wagon reflects their passion for performance and athleticism while also supporting their active social lifestyle with roomy, comfortable seating for five.<br> <br> Incorporating a unique high-rigidity rear body structure with a special hoop-style cross section, the Acura TSX Sport Wagon simultaneously provides excellent body strength.<br> <br> The standard 17-inch 5-spoke aluminum wheels for the 2.4L 4-cylinder models (sedan and Sport Wagon) now incorporate a machined lip on the face of the spokes. Split 5-spoke 18-inch aluminum wheels remain standard on the TSX sedan with 3.5L V-6 engine.<br> <br> Interior<br> <br> Inside, all 2011 TSX models receive a host of visual upgrades in the form of revised styling for the center console, darker trim pieces, brightly finished door handles, an updated parking brake handle and new garnishes for the steering wheel. In addition, contrasting-color stitching is new for the leather seats, door armrests and center console. Rear seat occupants will enjoy added comfort thanks to the addition of heating/cooling vents mounted at the rear of the center console, and the TSX\'s center console cargo compartment is now climate controlled.<br> <br> The all-new Acura TSX Sport Wagon features an even greater level of utility over the TSX sedan. Besides offering a generous 60.5 cu-ft of rear cargo area (with rear seats folded down), the wagon\'s rear opening height of approximately 28-inches allows for the stowage of bulky items such as large boxes, furniture, bicycles, four full-size golf bags and even surfboards.<br> <br> In addition, the Sport wagon features four hidden compartments for out-of-sight storage. A 2.4 cu-ft storage area is cleverly located beneath a lift-up hatch within the load floor. Smaller items can be placed in a 0.2 cu-ft storage area (hidden by a removable panel) located in the side panel on the driver side, or in one of two 13-inch long storage areas near the main in-floor storage area. With a low lift-over height of about 24-inches, loading heavy items is simplified. For increased security, standard is a retractable cover that prevents rear cargo items from being seen should a passer-by look into the rear windows.<br> <br> Even with the second row seat in use, there is generous cargo space available in the Sport Wagon. The rear seats have a 60/40 fold-down design, so one section can be lowered to generate more cargo room while the other section can remain in the up position to accommodate a rear seat passenger. Or, both seats can be folded down to attain the maximum cargo area replete with a load-flat floor that is nearly 70-inches long. As expected, the Sport Wagon incorporates a variety of tie-down hooks for keeping cargo items secure.<br> <br> The Acura TSX Sport Wagon\'s 60.5 cu-ft (rear seats folded down) of rear cargo area is more than most other wagon in the category- including the BMW 3-Series (54.7 cu-ft) and the Audi A4 (56.5 cu-ft). The Acura TSX Sport Wagon also rivals (or beats) the cargo capacity of some compact SUVs. Thus, the Sport Wagon is a smart alternative for those who are considering the purchase of a compact SUV - but who value the better fuel economy and the performance of a sports sedan.<br> <br> Acura is known for its outstanding array of user relevant technology, and the 2011 TSX further expands on this concept. New for 2011, the TSX with available Technology Package now includes an LED backlit full VGA navigation screen (that generates 400-percent higher resolution than before), improved navigation system functions (faster performance, improved search ability and expanded map coverage), Song By Voice™ (SBV) user interface, a 60-gigabyte hard disk drive (HDD), and the ability to download 15-gigabytes of personal music to the TSX\'s HDD. With the ability to store more than 3,500 songs, there is no longer a need to carry around bulky CDs.<br> <br> Acura has always put much emphasis on building an interior that is exceptionally quiet, and for 2011 the TSX has even greater cabin serenity thanks to items such as a new acoustic glass front windshield, even thicker side glass, increased use of sound-deadening insulation, improved floor mats and new underfloor covers.<br> <br> Drivetrain<br> <br> The 2011 TSX remains fun to drive thanks to two powerful engine choices; a spirited 2.4L inline four cylinder engine and a torquey 3.5L V-6. For 2011, both engines receive numerous improvements to reduce internal operating friction which help improve fuel economy and increase engine life. As a result, the friction reduction measures are a significant element to improve fuel economy as evidenced by improvements in the EPA city, highway and combined fuel economy for both the 2.4L I-4 and the 3.5L V-6 engines.<br> <br> New automatic transmission programming helps maximize the engine output by allowing for Shift Hold Control during cornering along with \"smart shift\" functionality that allows for semi-manual operation when in Drive- not just when in Sport Mode. In addition, the Sequential SportShift 5-speed automatic transmission now features a fluid warmer that helps improve shift quality, transmission durability and engine fuel economy for TSX owners who live in colder climates.<br> <br> Pricing<br> <br> On sale at Acura dealerships on November 23, the 2011 TSX sedan with 2.4L I-4 engine has an MSRP of $29,610 for both manual and automatic transmission models. Equipped with the available Technology package, the MSRP is $32,710. The TSX sedan with 3.5L V-6 engine has an MSRP of $35,150, or $38,250 when equipped with the Technology Package.<br> <br> The 2011 TSX Sport Wagon went on sale December 21, 2010 with a base price of $30,960.

The ZDX was nearly identical to the concept vehicle, with only a few changes to the headlights and bumpers. It was based on the successful model Acura MDX/Honda Pilot, but with sales under 10.000 units, it was a big loss for the Japanese car-maker.</p><p>From the beginning, the car-maker stated that the ZDX was a luxury four-door sport-coupe vehicle, even though it was based on an SUV platform. Its target was clearly the BMW X6 customers, but it was hard to beat the German offer with only one engine option on the table. The angular headlights, the air-intakes in the front bumper, and the sloped roof were just a few of the lines that made the ZDX a special vehicle.</p><p>Inside, Acura offered room for five adults and a decently sized trunk.

The segment bending Acura ZDX features stunning coupe-like styling with the added benefit of a commanding presence and flexible utility. Staying true to the prototype model that debuted at the 2009 New York International Auto Show in April, the production Acura ZDX will feature the key design highlights of a panoramic glass roof, hidden rear door handles and bold fender flares.</strong><br> <br> \"The Acura ZDX is like nothing you have ever seen before from Acura,\" said Jeff Conrad, vice president of Acura sales. \"It combines the best attributes of a coupe, a sedan and a sport utility - all wrapped in a beautifully sculpted package - that will attract an entirely new luxury customer to the Acura brand.\"<br> <br> Designed, developed and manufactured entirely in North America, the Acura ZDX breaks new ground for Acura in many ways. The Acura ZDX is the first vehicle to be styled from start to finish in the new, dedicated Acura Design Studio in Torrance, CA, allowing exterior and interior designers to work closely together throughout the entire design process. Staying true to the original sketch from Acura\'s first female designer, Michelle Christensen, the Acura ZDX features sensuous curves, deeply <br> <br> Inside, the Acura ZDX exhibits the highest levels of refinement and sophistication ever offered from Acura. Every Acura ZDX interior will feature Acura\'s first hand-stitched leather dashboard, door panels and sculpted center console. The rich leather appointments give the Acura ZDX a warm and inviting feeling while creating an intimate cockpit for the driver and front passenger. The cabin is well lit thanks to extensive use of LED lighting along with the light from the unique moonroof that is an integral design aspect of the longest glass roof in the industry. The panoramic glass roof has dual automatic sunshades that open and closes at the touch of a button.<br> <br> The luxurious cockpit gives way to generous cabin that provides comfortable seating for up to 5-passengers. The Acura ZDX\'s flexible utility allows it to be a perfect weekend getaway vehicle, allowing for 26.3 cubic feet of space behind the second row seats and a total of 55.8 cubic feet when the seats are folded flat. The cargo area can also be expanded to accommodate longer objects (such as golf bags) by removing side panels in the cargo-compartment sidewalls. As an added bonus, there is an integrated under-floor storage area which provides 2.2 cubic-feet of secure space.<br> <br> The all-new ZDX not only boasts head-turning style but also outstanding performance. The 3.7-liter SOHC V-6 all-aluminum engine generates 300 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque for immediate acceleration response, outstanding low- and mid-range torque and superior high-rpm power. The all-new 6-speed automatic transmission with steering wheel mounted paddle shifters gives the Acura ZDX excellent acceleration while also enhancing fuel economy. EPA estimated city/highway fuel mileage of 16/22 mpg and a large 21-gallon fuel capacity allow for the Acura ZDX to have a long cruising range. Plus, the ZDX complies with the latest EPA TIER 2 - BIN 5 and CARB LEV II ULEV emissions standards.<br> <br> Standard on the ZDX is Acura\'s exclusive Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®) system. SH-AWD® expands the Acura ZDX\'s appeal by providing outstanding handling as well as excellent all-season capability. Standard on the Acura ZDX are 19x8.5-inch 7-spoke aluminum alloy wheels- the largest standard wheel in the Acura lineup.<br> <br> Adding to the dynamic capabilities of the Acura ZDX is the available Integrated Dynamics System (IDS), which tailors the fully independent suspension\'s Active Damper System and speed-sensitive steering together to suit the driver\'s preference for a more comfortable or a more sporting ride - all available for easy change at the turn of a dial. Comfort mode prioritizes road isolation and reduced passenger fatigue, while Sport mode favors crisp handling response, heightened vehicle body control and maximum traction.<br> <br> Befitting its \"sports coupe\" design, the 2010 ZDX is longer, lower, wider and has a significantly wider track than its primary market competitors. The Acura ZDX rides on a 108.3-inch wheelbase with an overall length of 192.4 inches, it has an overall width of 85.6 inches with a 67.7-inch track front and rear, and it stands 62.8 inches tall. These dimensions allow the Acura ZDX to offer a driving character that is as confident as its appearance is dramatic.<br> <br> When the Acura ZDX goes on sale this winter, customers will have the choice of three distinct trim levels: ZDX, ZDX with Technology Package and the ZDX with Advance Package. Like all Acura models, the ZDX will come generously equipped. The panoramic glass roof with moveable sunshades, hand-stitched leather interior, Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® connectivity, power tailgate and a high powered audio system with CD player, AM/FM radio, XM® Satellite Radio and USB audio connectivity with iPod® integration are all standard features.<br> <br> The Acura ZDX with Technology Package adds several key features including an Acura Navigation System with Voice Recognition™, an Acura/ELS Surround® premium audio system and a new multi-view rear camera. The Advance Package boasts additional customer enhancing technologies like a blind spot information system, a Collision Mitigating Braking System™ (CMBS™) and Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC).<br> <br> When the Acura ZDX goes on-sale, it will bring a new level of prestige to the Acura lineup. The Acura ZDX will be positioned and priced between the Acura MDX luxury SUV and the Acura RL luxury performance sedan. ZDX pricing and additional details will be released at a later date.<br> <br> <strong>Powertrain</strong><br> <br> The all-new Acura ZDX is equipped with a new generation of the 3.7-liter SOHC V-6 engine that continues Acura\'s longstanding mission to provide V-8 level horsepower and torque with the size and fuel efficiency of a V-6. The all-aluminum engine develops 300 horsepower and 270 lb-ft of torque for immediate acceleration response, outstanding low- and mid-range torque and exciting high-rpm power.<br> <br> Helping broaden the powerband while simultaneously improving fuel efficiency of the latest 3.7L V-6 is a new 2-rocker arm design VTEC® (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) system applied to the intake valves. In addition, special high-lift camshaft specs during VTEC® operation, a dual-stage induction system and an electronic Drive-by-Wire™ throttle system team to improve engine performance.<br> <br> Performance and fuel economy are further enhanced by the Acura ZDX\'s all-new Sequential SportShift 6-speed automatic transmission that is designed to satisfy the most discerning enthusiast drivers. EPA estimated city/highway fuel mileage of 16/22 mpg and a large 21-gallon fuel capacity allow for the Acura ZDX to have a long cruising range. Plus, the ZDX complies with the latest EPA TIER 2 - BIN 5 and CARB LEV II ULEV emissions standards.<br> <br> Standard on the ZDX is Acura\'s exclusive Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD®) system, which is tuned for real-world driving conditions and has been performance proven on Germany\'s famed Nürburgring road course. Setting new standards for power delivery and handling response, SH-AWD® actively varies the torque distribution first between front and rear axles, and then between the left and right rear wheels, to maximize available traction under most driving situations. This \"torque vectoring\" operates automatically and seamlessly, and allows SH-AWD® to overdrive the outside rear wheel up to 1.7-percent faster than the front wheels- thus creating a \"yaw moment\" that allows the Acura ZDX to better rotate around a corner while minimizing vehicle understeer.<br> <br> <strong>Chassis</strong><br> <br> The Acura ZDX chassis was tuned to provide an ideal balance of handling precision, road isolation and damping. In front, MacPherson struts team with coil-over springs and forged-aluminum lower control arms for precise handling with generous wheel travel, while hydro-compliance suspension bushings and a front subframe that \"floats\" on rubber mounts provide superb road and engine isolation. The Acura ZDX\'s multi-link rear suspension mounts on a separate steel subframe and employs aluminum uprights for reduced unsprung weight; the coil springs, dampers and anti-roll bar are tuned for optimum ride and handling.<br> <br> Included with the available Advance Package, the new Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) tailors the Acura ZDX\'s fully independent suspension\'s Active Damper System and speed-sensitive steering to suit the driver\'s preference for a more comfortable or a more sporting ride - available at the touch of a switch. Comfort mode prioritizes road isolation and reduced passenger fatigue, while Sport mode favors crisp handling response, heightened vehicle body control and maximum traction.<br> <br> The heart of the Acura ZDX\'s Active Damper System is its electronically-controlled Magneto-Rheological shock absorbers, which can individually adjust from minimum to maximum damping force in as little as five milliseconds (0.005 sec.). Along with the active dampers, the speed-sensitive hydraulic steering assist is automatically adjusted according to the driver\'s choice of Comfort or Sport modes: lighter steering effort is generated in the Comfort mode, while firmer effort results when in Sport mode.<br> <br> <strong>Body</strong><br> <br> The exterior design goal for the Acura ZDX was to merge the emotional appeal of a sports coupe with excellent all-season ability and good ground clearance to allow for moderate off-highway use. The unique design of the wide rear fenders and aerodynamic cabin give the Acura ZDX a decisive and powerful appearance, while the panoramic glass roof provides occupants with a breathtaking view of the world around them.<br> <br> The unique moonroof design teams with the surrounding glass structure to make for the longest glass roof in the automotive market- stretching from the leading edge of the windshield to the trailing edge of the tailgate glass. In the front section of the glass roof is the moonroof that tilts and slides up and back along the outside of the roof. This opening design helps to preserve maximum interior headroom while also retaining the dramatic and personal \"sports coupe\" design of the cabin greenhouse. A fixed glass panel over the rear seat area further brightens the cabin. Dual motorized sunshades cover both the front and rear glass panels should the Acura ZDX occupants choose to reduce sunlight entering the interior, while a mesh fabric pop-up air deflector achieves a new standard for wind-noise performance when compared to a traditional blade-type wind deflector.<br> <br> <strong>Cargo</strong><br> <br> Opening the power-actuated tailgate reveals an impressively detailed rear cargo area that offers a total of 26.3 cubic feet of space behind the rear seats. Lined with premium loop-style carpet, the rear cargo area also offers a cleverly hidden 2.2 cubic-feet cargo bin positioned under the floor. Hidden behind removable side panels are additional storage areas in the cargo-compartment sidewalls. Like the under-floor access panel, the removable side panels have satin-metal release handles, and can be stored in the under-floor cargo bin to generate a wide load space designed to accommodate up to four golf bags. With the second-row seats folded, the Acura ZDX offers a fully carpeted near-flat load floor and a total of 55.8 cubic feet of cargo space.<br> <br> <strong>Interior</strong><br> <br> Combining premium materials with a new standard of attention-to-detail and craftsmanship, the Acura ZDX interior takes its place as the ultimate expression of Acura interior design. Following the \"2+Freedom\" design concept, the Acura ZDX interior emphasizes the needs of the driver and passenger, while also offering the loading freedom to easily accommodate a weekend golfing trip or a piece of bulky cargo. For occasional use, the Acura ZDX\'s second-row seats can comfortably accommodate two full-size adults, or three passengers for shorter rides.<br> <br> New manufacturing processes allow top-grade leather to precisely follow complex, flowing shapes on the instrument panel, center console and door panels. LED interior lighting and a striking center instrument panel that blacks out when not in use give the Acura ZDX a clean, technical feel.<br> <br> Standard Acura ZDX interior features include leather seating surfaces, a supportive 10-way adjustable power driver seat and an 8-way adjustable power passenger seat. Also standard is the panoramic glass roof, power tailgate and a dual-zone, dual-mode automatic climate control system with automatic humidity control and rear seat vents. Additional standard equipment includes a powerful 8-speaker audio system with 6-disc CD changer, AM/FM tuner, XM® Radio, Bluetooth® Audio, USB port connectivity (for items such as iPod®, iPhone®, or removable USB mass storage devices) and AUX jack interface (for portable MP3 music players).<br> <br> The Acura ZDX auto day/night rearview mirror includes an integrated rear view camera display, while Tech and Advance models display camera information on the navigation system\'s full VGA color display.<br> <br> <strong>Advanced Technology</strong><br> <br> An available Technology Package increases both connectivity and comfort. The package starts with a Keyless Access System with push-button start, luxurious full-grain Perforated Milano Premium Leather for the seating surfaces and an Acura Navigation System with Voice Recognition™. The system has an 8-inch full VGA high-resolution color display, uses navigation data stored on a built-in 60 GB hard disk drive (HDD) for impressively quick operation and includes AcuraLink Real-Time Traffic with Traffic Rerouting™ along with the AcuraLink Real-Time Weather™ with weather radar image maps. For the ultimate in connectivity, the AcuraLink® Satellite Communication System allows direct communication between the ZDX and Acura, including the ability to make automated appointments for vehicle service.<br> <br> The Technology Package also features Acura\'s renowned Acura/ELS Surround® premium audio system with a 435-watt Digital Sound Processor amplifier, a 10-speaker surround sound array and a built-in 15-gigabyte hard disk drive (HDD) media storage system that allows the Acura ZDX owner to download and store about 3,500 up to songs for later playback. The Acura/ELS Surround® premium audio system offers DVD-Audio (with 500-times higher resolution than traditional CD audio), DTS™, CD, AM/FM tuner, XM® Radio, Bluetooth® Audio, plus USB and AUX jack connectivity.<br> <br> The available Advance Package includes everything in the Technology Package, and adds premium brushed tricot headliner material, ventilated front seats, a sport steering wheel and additional LED ambient lighting. The Advance Package also includes Acura\'s Collision Mitigating Braking System™ (CMBS™), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), a blind spot information system and the Integrated Dynamics System (IDS) that controls the Active Damper System and speed-sensitive steering.<br> <br> <strong>Safety</strong><br> <br> Acura\'s acclaimed Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure and a comprehensive array of active and passive safety features help the 2010 ZDX offer a high level of passenger safety. The ACE™ body structure more evenly distributes collision forces throughout the vehicle and also helps maintain the integrity of the passenger cabin in the event of a severe frontal collision.<br> <br> Passive safety features include a dual-stage, multiple-threshold front airbag Supplemental Restraint System (SRS), dual-chamber side airbags with a passenger side Occupant Position Detection System (OPDS), front seats with active head restraints, knee bolsters for front occupants, side curtain airbags with rollover sensor and front seatbelts with an automatic tensioning system with integrated load limiters.<br> <br> Numerous standard \"active safety\" features that help the Acura ZDX driver minimize the risk of collision include Vehicle Stability Assist™ (VSA®) along with an anti-lock braking system (ABS) with Electronic Brake Distribution (EBD) and Brake Assist.<br> <br> An additional active safety feature included in the available Advance Package is the Collision Mitigating Braking System™ (CMBS™) which helps the driver reduce the likelihood of a collision by alerting the driver to potential collision situations and activating the brakes if the system determines a collision likely is unavoidable.<br> <br> Although the Acura ZDX has not yet been tested by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) as of press time, Acura internal testing projects the ZDX to achieve top ratings in NHTSA frontal and side impact testing, as well as earn GOOD ratings from the IIHS.<br> <br> Along with every other new Acura, the 2010 Acura ZDX is covered by a comprehensive 4-year/50,000 mile bumper-to-bumper limited warranty and a 6-year/70,000 miles powertrain limited warranty. Additional benefits of ownership include Acura Total Luxury Care (TLC), which provides free 24-hour roadside assistance, concierge service and trip routing.<br>','[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_4.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_5.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_6.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_7.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_8.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_9.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_10.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_23.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_24.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_25.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_26.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_27.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_45.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_46.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_47.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_48.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_49.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_50.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_51.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_52.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_53.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_54.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_55.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_56.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_57.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_58.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_59.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_60.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_61.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_62.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_63.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_11.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_12.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_13.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_14.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_15.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_16.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_17.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_18.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_19.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_20.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_21.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_22.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_28.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_30.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_31.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_32.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_33.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_34.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_35.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_36.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_37.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURAZDX-4065_38.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_39.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_40.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065_41.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-ZDX-4065

the Acura RL has received a mid-model change, as the Acura named the facelift, in 2008 for the 2009 model year. The improvements were found in most parts of the car.</strong></p><p></p><p>After a slow start in the premium market, the luxury brand from Honda introduced the first generation of the RL in 1996 with a front-wheel-drive model. It was more of a name change from the European Honda Legend to the U.S. version named Legend. A similar name was used before in the U.S. by Honda and the Japanese car-maker didn\'t want to confuse its customers with the same names for both brands. </p><p>The second generation of the RL was introduced in 2004 and it featured an electronically controlled all-wheel-drive system, named Super Handling AWD. A computer sensed the cornering direction and speed and adjusted the torque sent to the wheels, aiding the cornering abilities of the car. Even though the vehicle was not a sports sedan, it was able to achieve good performances while cornering.</p><p>From the outside, the facelift showed the new design for the grille, which looked like a shield. New, 18” light-alloy wheels were installed as standard, replacing the 17” wheels from the no-mmc version. The MMC RL suspension was upgraded with higher-rate coil springs, larger diameter anti-sway bars and stiffer bushings all around.</p><p>The engine was upgraded from a 3.5-liter to a 3.7-liter unit and it was mated to the same 5-speed automatic gearbox, but with paddle shifters behind the steering wheel. </p>','<strong>The redesigned 2009 Acura RL luxury sedan made its world debut at the 2008 Chicago Auto Show. Featuring bold, sleek exterior styling, an upgraded interior, advanced technologies and powerful new engine, the Acura RL once again pushes the limits of performance, style, and luxury. The 2009 Acura RL will go on-sale this spring at Acura dealerships nationwide.</strong><br> <br> The 2009 Acura RL furthers cutting edge technology with the addition of new high-tech items including AcuraLink® weather, AcuraLink® Traffic Rerouting™, a new Note function for XM® Radio, Active Sound Control, and Bluetooth® Audio to an already robust list of features found on the previous Acura RL. To enhance handling, new chassis technology abounds in the drivetrain in the form of improved Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™, a revised steering system, upgraded coil springs, better performing shock absorbers, larger rear stabilizer bar, and more aggressive wheels and tires. Performance improves with the Acura RL thanks to a new, larger 3.7-liter V-6 that incorporates the first ever SOHC use of VTEC® valvetrain actuation for both the intake and exhaust valves.<br> <br> \"RL represents the very best we have to offer in terms of engineering, technology, performance, luxury and safety\", said Dick Colliver, executive vice president, sales. \"It\'s designed for a new generation of performance-luxury buyers looking to travel more quickly, more efficiently and more connected to the world around them.\"<br> <br> For 2009, the Acura RL will be offered in three different trim levels including RL, RL with Technology Package and RL with Technology Package Plus CMBS™. All RL\'s receive a potent new 3.7-liter V-6 engine, Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™, a Bose® Surround Sound audio system, Bluetooth® HandsFreeLink® connectivity and a GPS-based solar-sensing climate control system. The Technology Package includes the satellite-linked Acura Navigation System with Voice Activation™ with rearview camera, AcuraLink® Real-time traffic, AcuraLink® weather, Traffic Rerouting™, a rear view back-up camera, Active Front Lighting System (AFS), ventilated front seats, and a wood/leather steering wheel and shift knob. The top Acura RL package is the Technology Package with CMBS™ which also includes Acura\'s acclaimed Collision Mitigation Braking System™ (CMBS™), Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), and genuine wood instrument panel trim.<br> <br> <strong>Powertrain</strong><br> <br> The innovation built into the new Acura RL begins with the most powerful engine ever offered in an Acura sedan. An all-new 3.7-liter V-6 engine develops 300 horsepower and 271 lb-ft of torque thanks to an innovative new VTEC™ valvetrain system for both the intake and exhaust valves, a higher compression ratio, along with a special dual-stage magnesium intake manifold that enables the intake to function as a single- or dual-plenum manifold design based on engine operating parameters. In addition to developing improved power and torque, the Acura RL engine meets tough CARB ULEV-2 emission standards and delivers good fuel economy. The RL\'s engine bay appears more upscale thanks to a new surround panel assembly that reduces visual distractions and focuses attention directly on the all-new 3.7-liter V-6 engine.<br> <br> To handle the higher power of the 3.7-liter engine, a new version of the Sequential SportShift 5-speed automatic transmission is fitted to the 2009 Acura RL. Featuring new \"smart\" F1®-style steering wheel mounted paddle shifters and a new straight-gate<br> console mounted gear selector, the Acura RL driver now has more gear control than ever before.<br> <br> The RL\'s acclaimed Super Handling All-Wheel Drive™ (SH-AWD™) system returns for 2009, but is now quicker responding and better performing.<br> <br> There are numerous traction advantages of all-wheel drive, yet SH-AWD™ does a key function that is not available with traditional AWD systems - SH-AWD™ utilizes torque vectoring to increase the rotation speed of an outside rear wheel during aggressive cornering to help the car turn more effectively while under power. This \"yaw\" function reduces the cornering load on the front tires to minimize understeer, to improve handling balance, and to escalate total cornering grip.<br> <br> <strong>Body and Chassis</strong><br> <br> To further enhance handling and ride comfort, the new Acura RL retains a fully independent suspension system with front double-wishbone and rear multi-link architecture. For 2009 the Acura RL features higher rate coil springs, larger diameter stabilizer bars, stiffer subframe mount bushings and improved design steering rack components. To further improve handling and looks, new 18-inch diameter 7-spoke aluminum wheels are matched with more aggressive tires (replacing the previous 17-inch wheel/tire offering).<br> <br> <strong>Exterior/Interior</strong><br> <br> The 2009 Acura RL\'s new exterior styling is not only more aggressive, but delivers excellent aerodynamics and reduced rear lift at higher speeds. The Acura RL\'s more athletic style foreshadows the power concealed by the new power plenum front grille and blow-formed aluminum hood. The RL\'s shape is taut and athletic, and its acceleration and cornering performance allow it to challenge the most capable German and Japanese sports sedans. Comfort, quietness and ride quality are also on a par with performance sedan competitors. For 2009, eight exterior colors are available - 5 of which are new - including a new pearl pigment process that improves luster and shine.<br> <br> Inside, the 2009 Acura RL features a more elegantly styled interior that includes more room for rear seat passengers, easier-to-use front seat belts, door-mounted pull pockets, softer arm rests, redesigned vents, larger/clearer lettering for HVAC controls, and easier actuation of climate control functions. A revised steering wheel with available genuine wood trim (included with the CMBS package) and metal-look accents is now fitted to the Acura RL along with a matching wood-trimmed transmission shift knob. Complementing the steering wheel are upgraded gauges that incorporate brushed metal accents for enhanced appearance. For 2009, additional insulation, a more high-tech design of Acura\'s acoustic glass windshield, and a new Active Sound Control (ASC) noise abatement system team to further reduce the Acura RL\'s already quiet cabin.<br> <br> The RL\'s perforated leather front seats now incorporate six levels of heated/cooled ventilation. Moreover, just like the driver\'s seat, the passenger front seat now has 10-way power adjustability. For 2009, the center panel controls are now more intuitive and are surrounded by a new background color along with improved quality wood patterned panels. These interior upgrades are complimented by advanced electronics that include a satellite-linked Acura Navigation System with Voice Activation™ along with the innovative AcuraLink® satellite communication system with Real-time traffic, AcuraLink® Traffic Rerouting™ and (new for 2009) AcuraLink® weather. The Acura RL is the first vehicle on the market to feature in-dash integrated, continually updated real-time weather information in a single-screen format. The spectacular Acura/Bose® 10-speaker Sound System with DVD-Audio returns but is now upgraded to include Bluetooth® Audio, even richer audio sound, a new Note function for XM® Radio, improved button legibility, and a USB connectivity port.<br> <br> <strong>Safety</strong><br> <br> The 2009 Acura RL retains Acura\'s extremely rigid Advanced Compatibility Engineering™ (ACE™) body structure that features extensive use of high-tensile steel and lightweight aluminum components to take vehicle construction beyond conventional safety protocols while keeping overall vehicle weight in check. The ACE™ structure\'s front-mounted polygonal main frame is designed to help prevent cabin deformation by distributing frontal impact forces through multiple load bearing pathways--and away from the passenger compartment. For 2009, to enhance safety a new Active Head Restraint System is built into the front seats to help improve neck and head protection in the event in a rear impact collision. To further aid in safety, the Acura RL includes as standard a passenger seatbelt reminder, Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPMS) and six airbags. These advances team to make the 2009 Acura RL the strongest, most powerful, best handling, safest and most luxurious sedan Acura has ever built.<br> <br> The Acura RL earned 5-star ratings (the best possible) for frontal and side crash tests, and for rollover resistance, from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The RL is the fourth vehicle in the history of the program to earn the top rating of \"5-star\" in all three test categories. Government star ratings are part of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration\'s (NHTSA) New Car Assessment Program. In addition, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) awarded the Acura RL its top rating of GOOD in Side Impact Collision Evaluation (SICE) along with a GOOD rating for IIHS\' frontal offset crash test. With a new Active Head Restraint System for front seat passengers, the 2009 Acura RL is anticipated to receive a GOOD rating in IIHS rear crash protection evaluation.<br>','[\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_6.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_7.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_8.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_9.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_10.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_11.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_12.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_13.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_14.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_15.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_16.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_17.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_18.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_19.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_20.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_21.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_22.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_23.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_24.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_25.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_26.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_27.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_28.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_29.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_30.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_31.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_32.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_33.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_34.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_35.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_1.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_2.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_3.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_4.jpg\",\"https:\\/\\/s1.cdn.autoevolution.com\\/images\\/gallery\\/ACURA-RL-4019_5.jpg\"]','2024-10-23 05:32:42','2024-10-23 05:32:42');
